<h4>Home School Partnerships</h4>
<p>Our school values parents’ partnership to raise a kind and confident generation
together. To ensure the holistic development of our students, our school
and parents work hand-in-hand to support teachers’ professional responsibilities.</p>
<p>Open, respectful conversations between educators and parents enable coordinated
and holistic support for the child. By showing mutual respect, we set a
positive example for the child.</p>
