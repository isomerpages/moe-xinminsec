We want to be the master of our destiny

We want to be the beacon of our time

Not through rote learning; but through the training of a versatile mind

With keen wit and a readiness to put knowledge into practice

We want to develop an analytical mind

We want to cultivate an innovative spirit

For love, integrity, freedom and peace

Xinmin Xinmin
