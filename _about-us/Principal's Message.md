Warm greetings from all of us at Xinmin!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Since 1945, Xinmin has grown from a humble village school to the outstanding education institution that it is today. While the contexts may have changed, what remains steadfast is our commitment to prepare our students well for their future ahead. Drawing our learning from what would qualify as a most anomalous 2020, we were offered a glimpse of the possibilities presented by a different paradigm of learning and teaching - one which harnesses technology, and which features students' self-directedness and voice more strongly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
These resonate with what we do in Xinmin. Beyond providing our students with a strong foundation for further learning, we equip all our students with competencies like critical and analytical thinking, collaboration and leadership through providing opportunities for them to create, connect and cultivate. We also emphasise character education and inculcate our values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience in all that we do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The secondary school years are a time where students explore their different interests and strengths and work towards their aspirations. We support this by offering our students multiple opportunities to discover and pursue their interests and passions, and through these experiences, develop holistically. It is also for this reason that we offer a range of options to our students in both the academic and co-curricular areas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The greatest strength of the school is our team of caring, committed and dedicated teachers. With a shared philosophy that “all students are unique individuals with talents”, the staff continue to guide our students to discover their strengths and achieve to the best of their potential. This established culture of care in the school endears students to their teachers, and spurs them to live by our school motto “From Each His Best”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
We aspire to continue to work hand-in-hand with our community partners to provide additional learning platforms and opportunities to develop our students’ 21st century competencies. Through the invaluable partnerships cultivated over the years with the School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, institutes of higher learning, People’s Association grassroots organisations, Kolam Ayer Community Club, Central Singapore CDC, SINDA and the industry partners, we are well-placed to meet the challenges ahead of us. Together with our community partners, Bendemeer Secondary School will continue to work towards nurturing students who are future-ready and rooted in values – Bendemeerians who will be Active Learners, Responsible Citizens.</p>
