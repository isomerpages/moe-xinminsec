Warm greetings from all of us at Xinmin!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Since 1945, Xinmin has grown from a humble village school to the outstanding education institution that it is today. While the contexts may have changed, what remains steadfast is our commitment to prepare our students well for their future ahead. Drawing our learning from what would qualify as a most anomalous 2020, we were offered a glimpse of the possibilities presented by a different paradigm of learning and teaching - one which harnesses technology, and which features students' self-directedness and voice more strongly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
These resonate with what we do in Xinmin. Beyond providing our students with a strong foundation for further learning, we equip all our students with competencies like critical and analytical thinking, collaboration and leadership through providing opportunities for them to create, connect and cultivate. We also emphasise character education and inculcate our values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience in all that we do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The secondary school years are a time where students explore their different interests and strengths and work towards their aspirations. We support this by offering our students multiple opportunities to discover and pursue their interests and passions, and through these experiences, develop holistically. It is also for this reason that we offer a range of options to our students in both the academic and co-curricular areas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Complementing our rigorous and enriching school-based curriculum, our school also offers state-of-the-art facilities like our Creative Arts Complex for our students to extend their learning of, and deepen their appreciation for the arts. It also presents our students with a platform to perform for the community, and through this, build positive relationships with our neighbours in the community.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
With our fraternity of committed and competent staff members and strong support from our stakeholders, we are committed to develop our students into the Curious Learners, Compassionate Contributors and Confident Leaders. Indeed, Xinmin Secondary School has an established tradition of producing graduates who create positive impact in their respective fields. We hope you will join our Xinmin family, and we are confident that you, like many others before you, will benefit from and enjoy the Xinmin experience!</p>
