Xinmin Secondary School is an institution of excellence that has nurtured many generations of students to be curious learners, compassionate contributors, and confident leaders. Founded in 1945, Xinmin draws strength from our rich heritage while simultaneously looking ahead to prepare our students well for the future. From our beginning as a community school till today, the essence of a Xinmin education is to develop leaders of hearts and leaders of minds, anchored on our values of Respect, Responsibility, and Resilience. At the same time, we continually review our total curriculum and scan educational developments to design learning experiences that develop 21st Century Competencies and dispositions in our students.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
As an autonomous school, we develop our students holistically and cultivate their talents by complementing the Singapore national curriculum with a range of thoughtfully-developed signature programmes. Our signature programmes are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
* Coding@Xinmin, focusing on computational thinking and design thinking;
* RefleXions@Xinmin, developing empathy and collaboration skills;
* XinminCares, fostering civic character and the will to act; and
* the Student Leadership Academy, honing leadership competencies and confidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The secondary school years are a time where students explore their different interests and strengths and work towards their aspirations. We support this by offering our students multiple opportunities to discover and pursue their interests and passions, and through these experiences, develop holistically. It is also for this reason that we offer a range of options to our students in both the academic and co-curricular areas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Complementing our rigorous and enriching school-based curriculum, our school also offers state-of-the-art facilities like our Creative Arts Complex for our students to extend their learning of, and deepen their appreciation for the arts. It also presents our students with a platform to perform for the community, and through this, build positive relationships with our neighbours in the community.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
With our fraternity of committed and competent staff members and strong support from our stakeholders, we are committed to develop our students into the Curious Learners, Compassionate Contributors and Confident Leaders. Indeed, Xinmin Secondary School has an established tradition of producing graduates who create positive impact in their respective fields. We hope you will join our Xinmin family, and we are confident that you, like many others before you, will benefit from and enjoy the Xinmin experience!</p>
