Xinmin Secondary School is an institution of excellence that has nurtured many generations of students to be curious learners, compassionate contributors, and confident leaders. Founded in 1945, Xinmin draws strength from our rich heritage while simultaneously looking ahead to prepare our students well for the future. From our beginning as a community school till today, the essence of a Xinmin education is to develop leaders of hearts and leaders of minds, anchored on our values of Respect, Responsibility, and Resilience. At the same time, we continually review our total curriculum and scan educational developments to design learning experiences that develop 21st Century Competencies and dispositions in our students.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
As an autonomous school, we develop our students holistically and cultivate their talents by complementing the Singapore national curriculum with a range of thoughtfully-developed signature programmes. Our signature programmes are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
	
* Coding@Xinmin, focusing on computational thinking and design thinking;
* RefleXions@Xinmin, developing empathy and collaboration skills;
	
* XinminCares, fostering civic character and the will to act; and
* the Student Leadership Academy, honing leadership competencies and confidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The academic subjects, co-curricular programmes, and signature programmes form our school’s total curriculum that we provide for every Xinmin student entrusted to us. The total curriculum is augmented by the Xinmin Talent Development Approach, through which opportunities for students to develop their talents are organised along five domains – cognitive, aesthetics, psychomotor, community, and leadership – to empower every Xinmin student to soar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Xinmin is blessed with a team of caring teachers and allied educators committed to reaching new peaks of excellence, and dedicated administrative and operational staff working hand in hand to ensure effective teaching and learning in the student development and academic domains. With strong support from the School Advisory Committee, alumni, and parents, our Xinmin family lives out the words of our school song every day by placing learning and growth at the centre of all we do: so that our students will be masters of their destiny and beacons of their time – not just for themselves, but also for love, integrity, freedom and peace.</p>

We welcome you to join us – as students, parents, and partners – on this special journey together!</p>
