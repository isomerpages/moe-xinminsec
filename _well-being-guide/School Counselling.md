Introduction
------------

Sometimes life can be tough, and teenagers growing up can be under pressure.

  

Having someone, you can really talk to may be a help - perhaps a friend, a teacher, your parents, or someone in the family.

  

At times, everyone feels worried or has problems that may be hard to talk about with the people close to you.  You may worry about whether they will understand, whether you can trust them, whether they will blame you, or ignore your feelings.  That is when you may think about talking to the school counsellor.

Why there is a need for school counselling?
-------------------------------------------

*   As Change    
*   As Prevention    
*   As Life enhancement

  

School Counselling aims at helping the our students in improving the ways of coping with problems, adapting to changing life demands, and having a new and deeper understanding, appreciation, and wisdom about life's many potentialities. 

How does counselling work?
--------------------------

Counselling Service is part of the Whole-school Framework for Learning, Emotional, and Behavioural Support.

  

Seeing the school counsellor might be your idea, or your parents’ or a teacher might suggest it.

  

You do not have to decide straight away.  You can meet the school counsellor first, to ask questions and find out more.  Counselling should be voluntary to be effective in supporting you.  

Who are the school counsellors?
-------------------------------

School counselling is carried out by trained school counsellors. They are employed by the MOE or the school, and work within a code of ethics and practice.

  

Our school counsellor has the following educational qualifications:

  

*   Diploma in School Counselling (National Institute of Education, Singapore)
*   Bachelor of Science in Psychology (University of Southern Queensland, Australia)
*   Bachelor of Arts (National University of Singapore) 

  

She is also trained in _Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)_ and _Teach .b program_.
