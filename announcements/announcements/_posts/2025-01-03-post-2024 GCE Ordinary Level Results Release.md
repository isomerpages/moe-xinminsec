<p>Dear Students, Parents, and Guardians,</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment
Board (SEAB) have announced that the results of the Singapore-Cambridge
GCE O-Level Examinations will be released on Friday, 10 January at 2 pm.</p>
<p>Students should report to the Multi-Purpose Hall at 1.30 pm. You are reminded
to be in your school uniform, and to adhere to the schoolâ€™s attire and
grooming guidelines. Parents and guardians are welcome to accompany students
to school to collect their results.</p>
<p>To ensure the safety and well-being of our students and staff, students
who are unwell should seek medical attention and not return to school to
collect their results. They should appoint a proxy to collect a physical
copy of their results from the school, and they may contact the school
for assistance with the appointment of a proxy. If students are recovering
from respiratory-related illnesses and are in school to collect their results,
they should exercise social responsibility and wear a mask.</p>
<p>Please refer to links below for a message and information sheet that contains
more tips and resources for students, parents, and guardians.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support and partnership.</p>
