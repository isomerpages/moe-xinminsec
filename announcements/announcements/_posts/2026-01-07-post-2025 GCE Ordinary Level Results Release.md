<p>Dear Students, Parents, and Guardians,</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment
Board (SEAB) have announced that the results of the Singapore-Cambridge
GCE O-Level Examinations will be released on <strong>Wednesday, 14 January 2026 at 2 pm</strong>.</p>
<p>Students should report to the <strong>Multi-Purpose Hall at 1.30 pm</strong>.
You are reminded to be in your school uniform, and to adhere to the school’s
attire and grooming guidelines. Parents and Guardians are welcome to accompany
students to school to collect their results. If you or your child cannot
collect the O-Level results at school, you can nominate another adult to
do so using this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/api/media/87f750a5-f740-435c-acaa-65d1b3f6481e/JAE-Proxy-Form.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proxy form</a>.</p>
<p>To ensure the safety and well-being of our students and staff, students
who are unwell should seek medical attention and not return to school to
collect their results. They should appoint a proxy to collect a physical
copy of their results from the school, and they may contact the school
for assistance with the appointment of a proxy. If students are recovering
from respiratory-related illnesses and are in school to collect their results,
they should exercise social responsibility and wear a mask.</p>
<p>Please refer to links below for a message and information sheet that contains
more tips and resources for students, parents, and guardians.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support and partnership.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Attachment</u></strong>
