<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>In meting out disciplinary consequences for various offences, the school
management aims to consider the 3 dimensions of justice listed below. Through
this approach, and by considering mitigating factors, the school will safeguard
the principle of fairness.</p>
<p>1. Commutative Justice governs the relationship between one individual
and another.</p>
<p>2. Distributive Justice governs the relationship between the community
as a whole and individuals or smaller groups</p>
<p>3. Legal Justice directs the relationship of individuals to the good of
the community at large.</p>
<p>Consequences for offences in <strong>Category A </strong>include warning,
suspension from class, detention, demerit points, confiscation, appropriate
restitution, and corrective work orders.</p>
<p>Confiscation of mobile electronic devices will be for 5 school days with
1 demerit point. Repeat offenders will have demerit points in addition
to the confiscation for 5 school days.</p>
<p>For attire offences, immediate corrective action will be taken by the
school to bring about compliance. These will include bringing students
for haircut, confiscating unauthorised items or apparel.</p>
<p>While undergoing suspension or detention, students may be required to
write reflections, essays or a letter of undertaking promising not to commit
the offence again and undergo in-house counselling by teachers. Repeat
offenders may be issued with a formal warning letter and have their offences
upgraded to Category C.</p>
<p>For <strong>Category B</strong> offences, the measures meted out are similar,
but more demerit points may be given than those in Category A. In addition,
parents may be invited to school to meet with teachers to discuss the student’s
behaviour and further disciplinary actions or follow up.</p>
<p>Students may also be referred for counselling or any other appropriate
programmes deemed fit by the school management.</p>
<p>The school may partner with external agencies to organise intervention
programmes which the students will be required to participate in.</p>
<p>For <strong>Category C </strong>offences, over and above the measures described
in Category A and B, Category C offences warrant additional demerit points,
caning and suspension from school.</p>
<p>Students who are suspended from school will not be allowed to re-sit any
tests or exams missed as a result of the suspension. Re-admission to school
after suspension will be based on the conditions set by the School Management.</p>
<p>In addition, students may be put on probation, during which they may be
required to perform community services or responsibility programmes.</p>
<p>Offences that involve violation of the law may be referred to the Police.
Recalcitrant offenders who do not respond positively to the school’s intervention
measures may be required to withdraw from school or face expulsion from
school.</p>
