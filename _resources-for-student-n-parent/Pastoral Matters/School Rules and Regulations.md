<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In enforcing the school rules and regulations, we aim to teach students
the values of Respect, Responsibility, and Resilience. We hope to teach
students how to uphold standards of behaviour that are acceptable in school
and society. Overall, the rules and regulations are designed to create
a safe and secure environment for all students to learn and for staff to
carry out their duties.</p>
<p>Respect, kindness, and inclusion are at the heart of our school community.
It is fundamental to everything we do, shaping how we communicate, collaborate,
and care for one another. Each member of the community shares the responsibility
of creating a safe and supportive learning environment built on mutual
respect and understanding.</p>
<p>Any form of hurtful behaviour and bullying is wrong and unacceptable.
Bullying can be cyber, physical, social/relational or verbal in nature.
We also maintain a zero tolerance policy towards any unlawful or disruptive
conduct, including intimidation and retaliation in all their forms. We
will take action when informed of such cases.</p>
