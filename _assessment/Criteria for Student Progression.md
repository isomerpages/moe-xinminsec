<p>Under Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB), the criteria for student progression
aligns to the broader efforts by MOE to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>give students greater ownership of their learning according to their readiness,
strengths, interests, and learning needs, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage students to develop a growth mindset and an intrinsic motivation
to learn for life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All students generally progress to the next year of learning</strong>,
guided by a common academic requirement that applies at the end of Secondary
2 and Secondary 3.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Secondary 1 students will progress to Secondary 2 as the lower secondary
curriculum is a two-year block. This eases the transition of a student
from primary to secondary school and provides time for students to adjust
to the curriculum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary 1 and Secondary 2 students who have done well could consider
offering subjects at more demanding level (MDL). To offer a subject at
MDL, refer to the respective <a href="our-curriculum/academic-learning/lower-sec-programme-2024/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">eligibility criteria</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of Secondary 2 and Secondary 3, students need to meet the academic
requirement to offer subjects at the same subject levels in the following
year.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><u>Academic Requirement</u></strong>: Pass^ (a) EL and 2 subjects,
or (b) at least half the total number of examinable subjects* offered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who do not meet the academic requirement are to offer fewer subjects
and/or offer subjects at a less demanding level (LDL).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>^ ‘Pass’ refers to subject overall mark of at least 50%, regardless of subject level.</em>
</p>
<p><em>* ‘Examinable subjects’ do not include CCE, PE and lower secondary Music.</em>
