<h4><strong>2025 Secondary 1 and Secondary 2 Students</strong></h4>
<p>Under Full Subject-Based Banding, the criteria for student progression
aligns to the broader efforts by MOE to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>give students greater ownership of their learning according to their readiness,
strengths, interests and learning needs, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage students to develop a growth mindset and an intrinsic motivation
to learn for life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All students generally progress to the next year of learning</strong>,
guided by a common academic requirement that applies at the end of Secondary
2 and Secondary 3.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Secondary 1 students will progress to Secondary 2 as the lower secondary
curriculum is a two-year block. This eases the transition of a student
from primary to secondary school and provides time for students to adjust
to the curriculum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of Secondary 2 and Secondary 3, students need to meet the academic
requirement to offer subjects at the same subject levels:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pass^ (a) EL and 2 subjects, or</p>
<p>(b) at least half the total number of examinable subjects* offered</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Secondary 1 and 2 students progressing to the next year of learning have
opportunities to calibrate curricular load based on the school’s holistic
considerations of what is educationally meaningful for each student.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students who have met the academic requirement and have done well could
consider offering subjects at more demanding level (MDL). To offer a subject
at MDL, students need to have obtained ≥75% in subject overall marks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who have not met the academic requirement are to offer fewer
subjects and/or offer subjects at less demanding level (LDL).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>^ ‘Pass’ refers to subject overall mark of at least 50%, regardless of subject level.</em>
</p>
<p><em>* ‘Examinable subjects’ do not include CCE, PE and lower secondary Music.</em>
</p>
<h4><strong>2025 Secondary 3 Students</strong></h4>
<p>To be promoted to Secondary 4, students will have to meet the minimum
attainment level for their respective streams:</p>
