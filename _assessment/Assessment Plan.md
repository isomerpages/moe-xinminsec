<p>In line with MOE's announcements about the removal of Mid-Year examinations
and the revisions to school-based assessments, a new assessment plan to
better support our students' learning has been implemented.</p>
<p>The reasons for making this change include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>to create more time and space for our students to deepen their learning,
better enjoy the process of learning, and develop dispositions for lifelong
learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to encourage our students to revise their work more regularly throughout
the year and not just prepare for summative assessments; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to give our students more time to develop their knowledge and skills in
the respective subjects before their summative assessment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assessment plan for Sec 1 to Sec 3 students are as follows:</p>
<table style="minWidth: 100px">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Term 1</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Term 2</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Term 3</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Term 4</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>WA1 (10%)</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>WA2 (15%)</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>WA3 (15%)</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>EOY Exam (60%)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;For Sec 1 to 3 students, Weighted Assessments (WAs) consisting of
written class tests, and alternative assessments such as online assignments,
projects and practical tests will be conducted in Term 1, 2 and 3. We hope
that the current assessment plan will help to reduce the assessment load
and nudge the students to revise their work regularly throughout the year.</p>
<p><em>*Semestral-based subjects e.g., D&amp;T and FCE will follow subject-specific assessment plans.</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;For Sec 4 and 5 students, they will be taking the following assessments:</p>
<table style="minWidth: 75px">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Term 1</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Term 2</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Term 3</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>WA1</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>WA2</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Preliminary Examination</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p></p>
<p>Their results will be reported in the form of progress reports and result
slips. However, only the scores obtained during the Preliminary Examinations
will be used in the computation of school grades for their graduating year.
Sec 4 and 5 students will not be graded based on alternative modes of assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Weighted Assessments</strong>
</p>
<p>WAs are not intended to be conducted as the national examinations, where
they cause undue anxiety and stress for students. Students should treat
each WA as gradual build-up of knowledge, skills and understandings in
preparation for the final summative assessment (examinations).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each term, WAs are conducted between Week 5 to Week 9 (for Term 1),
Week 3 to Week 8 (for Term 2) and Week 3 to Week 9 (for Term 3).&nbsp;
WAs are no longer administered in a common time slot. Instead, WA will
take place during the timetabled subject time slot in the designated week
for the class. Specific dates on which a subject’s WA are conducted may
hence differ amongst classes. Within the stipulated week, teachers must
negotiate the day of the week (test dates) with their class and provide
this information to their IP Heads. This information must be reflected
on the XO-Test Book System and manually written on the class’s notice-board’s
calendar to reduce clashing of test dates amongst different subjects.</p>
<p>To manage our students' overall assessment load:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the WAs amongst different subjects have been spaced out across the weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are no more than two written WAs scheduled on a given day; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not more than three written WAs per week.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WA Schedule will be released and published on our school website from
the Week 3 of Term 1 and Week 1 of Terms 2 and 3.</p>
