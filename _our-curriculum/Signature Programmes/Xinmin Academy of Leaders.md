<h2>Our Beliefs and Desired Outcomes:</h2>
<p>At Xinmin Academy of Leaders, we believe that every child has the potential
to lead. Guided by a whole-school approach, the Academy offers a spectrum
of programmes and projects designed to nurture confident leaders who inspire
hearts and minds. In line with our Desired Xinmin Outcomes (Every Xinmin
Student a Confident Leader), we aim to develop leaders who are rooted in
strong values with a strong sense of purpose, and lead with empathy and
integrity — individuals who are self-aware, display moral courage and resilience,
are guided by the school’s core values, and inspires and work effectively
with others towards shared goals. Through our progressive, multi-tiered
developmental programme, students cultivate resilience, strengthen their
sense of purpose to serve, and hone their communication skills to lead
with conviction and compassion.</p>
<p>At Xinmin Academy of Leaders, our guiding motto — <strong>Listen, Learn, and Lead </strong>—
reflects our commitment to nurturing principled and exemplary leaders.
The Academy is anchored by three leadership boards: the <strong>CCA Leaders Board</strong>; <strong>Peer Support Board; </strong>and
the <strong>Student Council</strong>. They are united under the <strong>Xinmin Council of Exemplary Leaders (XCEL)</strong>,
who unite and bridge the efforts of these leadership boards. Together,
they serve as the collective voice of the student body, serving the student
body and shaping the culture and spirit of the school.</p>

<h2>Academy Development Modules and Opportunities:</h2>
<p>We believe that students’ leadership qualities are also developed through
their daily activities and interactions. Through the suite of leadership
programmes and opportunities offered in our Academy, our students leave
as individuals who display Awareness, Moral Courage, Resilience, Purpose
and Confidence in Communicating:</p>
