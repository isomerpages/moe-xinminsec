<h2>Our Beliefs and Desired Outcomes:</h2>
<p>At Xinmin Academy of Leaders, we believe that every child has the potential
to lead. Guided by a whole-school approach, the Academy offers a spectrum
of programmes and projects designed to nurture confident leaders who inspire
hearts and minds. In line with our Desired Xinmin Outcomes (Every Xinmin
Student a Confident Leader), we aim to develop leaders who are rooted in
strong values with a strong sense of purpose, and lead with empathy and
integrity — individuals who are self-aware, display moral courage and resilience,
are guided by the school’s core values, and inspires and work effectively
with others towards shared goals. Through our progressive, multi-tiered
developmental programme, students cultivate resilience, strengthen their
sense of purpose to serve, and hone their communication skills to lead
with conviction and compassion.</p>
<p>At Xinmin Academy of Leaders, our guiding motto — <strong>Listen, Learn, and Lead </strong>—
reflects our commitment to nurturing principled and exemplary leaders.
The Academy is anchored by three leadership boards: the <strong>CCA Leaders Board</strong>; <strong>Peer Support Board; </strong>and
the <strong>Student Council</strong>. They are united under the <strong>Xinmin Council of Exemplary Leaders (XCEL)</strong>,
who unite and bridge the efforts of these leadership boards. Together,
they serve as the collective voice of the student body, serving the student
body and shaping the culture and spirit of the school.</p>

<h2>Student Leadership Framework</h2>
<p>Our Student Leadership Development framework is anchored in The Student
Leadership Challenge by Kouzes and Posner, and embodies our school’s motto
of “Leading Hearts, Leading Minds.” It reflects our belief that by practising
the five exemplary leadership behaviours, every student can grow into a
compassionate and thoughtful leader who leads with both empathy and intellect.</p>

for various leadership initiatives. Serving as a bridge among the various
leadership groups, XCEL plays a key role in strengthening school culture
and fostering a sense of unity and pride. XCEL also plans and leads major

<p>XCEL has led various level-wide town halls and focus group discussions
to better understand the needs of the student body, with the aim of enhancing
the school environment as well as students’ well-being and sense of belonging.
They have also spearheaded school-wide initiatives such as the redesign
of the school’s PE shirt and the organisation of the Caring Teacher Awards.</p>
<p><strong>Student Council</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Student Council</strong> is at the heart of student representation,
working tirelessly to serve the student body and strengthen school identity
and pride. They ensure the smooth running of flag-raising every morning
and improve the school experience for students through initiatives such
as Movie Night and Xtivities@Recess. Through hallmark events such as the
Student Leaders’ Investiture, All Staff Day, Gala Night, and various student-led
initiatives, they create platforms for celebration, recognition, and unity
within the school community.</p>
