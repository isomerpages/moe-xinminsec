Philosophy and Desired Outcomes of XAL:
-------


Every child can be a leader. Our Student Leadership Academy adopts a whole-school approach to provide a range of programmes and projects that will groom every student to lead hearts and minds with confidence.

In Xinmin, students are empowered to take ownership in their learning. Our Academy develops leaders beyond the Desired Xinmin Outcomes for Leadership through a multi-tiered programme that develops confident leaders who lead with compassion. 

We strive towards leaders who lead with a heart; being self-aware and mindful of those around them whilst displaying moral courage with the school’s core values in mind. Students develop resilience, a stronger purpose to serve as a leader and communication skills through our multi-tiered developmental programme.
