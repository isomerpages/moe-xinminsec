<h2>Our Beliefs and Desired Outcomes:</h2>
<p>At Xinmin Academy of Leaders, we believe that every child has the potential
to lead. Guided by a whole-school approach, the Academy offers a spectrum
of programmes and projects designed to nurture confident leaders who inspire
hearts and minds. In line with our Desired Xinmin Outcomes (Every Xinmin
Student a Confident Leader), we aim to develop leaders who are rooted in
strong values with a strong sense of purpose, and lead with empathy and
integrity — individuals who are self-aware, display moral courage and resilience,
are guided by the school’s core values, and inspires and work effectively
with others towards shared goals. Through our progressive, multi-tiered
developmental programme, students cultivate resilience, strengthen their
sense of purpose to serve, and hone their communication skills to lead
with conviction and compassion.</p>
<p>At Xinmin Academy of Leaders, our guiding motto — <strong>Listen, Learn, and Lead </strong>—
reflects our commitment to nurturing principled and exemplary leaders.
The Academy is anchored by three leadership boards: the <strong>CCA Leaders Board</strong>; <strong>Peer Support Board; </strong>and
the <strong>Student Council</strong>. They are united under the <strong>Xinmin Council of Exemplary Leaders (XCEL)</strong>,
who unite and bridge the efforts of these leadership boards. Together,
they serve as the collective voice of the student body, serving the student
body and shaping the culture and spirit of the school.</p>

<h2>Student Leadership Framework</h2>
<p>Our Student Leadership Development framework is anchored in The Student
Leadership Challenge by Kouzes and Posner, and embodies our school’s motto
of “Leading Hearts, Leading Minds.” It reflects our belief that by practising
the five exemplary leadership behaviours, every student can grow into a
compassionate and thoughtful leader who leads with both empathy and intellect.</p>

their dedication to strengthening bonds and celebrating talents.</p>

<p>The Sec 3 Student Leaders from all three leadership boards participated
in the Student Leadership Training, designed to help them understand and
apply <em>The Student Leadership Challenge</em>. Through this training,
students learnt to practise the five leadership behaviours—Model the Way,
Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act, and
Encourage the Heart—within authentic leadership scenarios. They reflected
on their personal influence and its impact on others, developed and communicated
a shared vision aligned with team goals, and applied effective conflict
management strategies to build and sustain positive relationships within
their boards.</p>
