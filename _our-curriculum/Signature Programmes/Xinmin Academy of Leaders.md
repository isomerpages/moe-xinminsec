<h2>Our Beliefs and Desired Outcomes:</h2>
<p>Every child can be a leader. Our Xinmin Academy of Leaders adopts a whole-school
approach to provide a range of programmes and projects that will groom
every student to lead hearts and minds with confidence.</p>
<p>In Xinmin, students are empowered to take ownership in their learning.
Our Academy develops leaders beyond the Desired Xinmin Outcomes for Leadership
through a multi-tiered programme that develops confident leaders who lead
with compassion.</p>
<p>We strive towards leaders who lead with a heart; being self-aware and
mindful of those around them whilst displaying moral courage with the school’s
core values in mind. Students develop resilience, a stronger purpose to
serve as a leader and communication skills through our multi-tiered developmental
programme.</p>
