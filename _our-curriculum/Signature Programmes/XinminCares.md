<h2>Cultivating Compassion, Creating Change</h2>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong>
<br>The XinminCares Programme is our signature Values-In-Action (VIA) programme
in the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum. This programme actively
includes all Secondary 1 and 2 students.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we do it?</strong>
<br>Through XinminCares, we hope to develop every Xinmin student into a compassionate
contributor who respects diverse perspectives and needs of different individuals
and recognises his/her ability to address issues in our community.</p>
<p><strong>How do we do it?</strong>
<br>We prioritise teaching our students the value of sincerity in their time
and efforts. We start by guiding them to think about the needs of the organisations
and individuals they are interacting with. This understanding helps them
connect on a deeper level, enabling them to act and contribute in a genuinely
meaningful way.</p>
<p><strong>Our Students’ XinminCares Projects</strong>
</p>
<p>XinminCares provides opportunities for students to play a part to make
their greater community a more inclusive and caring place for everyone.
During the XinminCares Fair, students will first understand the needs of
the beneficiaries before they decide as a class the community they wish
to support. Some beneficiaries include Singapore Cancer Society, Thye Hwa
Kuan Nursing Home and Migrant Worker’s Centre (MWC).</p>
<p><strong>We want to make a difference!</strong>
<br>Through XinminCares, our students are encouraged to be active and reflective
contributors who take responsibility for their community. Through taking
concrete action, students will appreciate the many complex societal issues
and challenges that their community and nation face and commit to make
a positive impact to address such issues within their sphere of influence.</p>

<br><strong>XinminCares Day (XCUBE 1 Programme)</strong>
</p>
<p>XinminCares Day is the grand finale of the XinminCares programme. Students
will consolidate their learning and reflection by advocating the needs
of the beneficiaries they worked with to their peers. In addition, XinminCares
Day is also an important event where students acquire deeper understanding
on the challenges that people with disabilities face daily through experiential
learning. Activities such as seated volleyball and goalball also provide
opportunities for students to participate in paralympic sports.</p>
