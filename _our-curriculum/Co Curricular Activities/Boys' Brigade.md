<h4><strong>45<sup>th</sup> Boys’ Brigade Company, Xinmin Secondary School</strong></h4>
<p>The mission of the 45th Boys' Brigade (BB) Company at Xinmin is to instil
key values of obedience, reverence, discipline, self-respect, and leadership
in its members.</p>
<p>Our comprehensive programme offers a wide range of opportunities for the
boys to plan, lead, and actively participate in. These include adventure
camps, badge-work activities, and drills, all while emphasizing the importance
of caring for others and serving the community. We also equip our boys
with essential life skills such as first aid and field cooking, preparing
them to face any challenges that may arise.</p>
<p>While we maintain high UG standards, we also ensure the boys experience
plenty of fun and excitement. Our adventure camps incorporate unique activities
like aerial yoga, K-pop dance, neon laser tag, and rock climbing to strengthen
camaraderie and team spirit among the company.</p>
<p>Throughout their four to five years in Boys' Brigade, we aim to nurture
every boy's social, educational, spiritual, and physical development, empowering
them to take on leadership roles and mentor their juniors.</p>
<p>Come experience for yourself the exciting activities that our boys take
pride in:</p>

<h4><strong>Leadership Development:</strong></h4>
<p>The Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Council plays a pivotal role in both
shaping the brigade and fostering the boys’ holistic growth. They hone
their leadership skills by leading many of our key programmes, providing
mentorship and guidance to younger boys, and forming the backbone of our
day-to-day operations.</p>

<h4><strong>Excellence:</strong></h4>
<p>This year, BB45th proudly celebrates three significant achievements. First,
inclusion in the BB Blaze Competition Gold Honour Roll highlights the boys'
resilience and teamwork in a physically challenging environment. Additionally,
two members were awarded the prestigious Founder’s Award, recognizing their
exemplary conduct and character. Furthermore, receiving a High Distinction
in the JM Fraser Award for Excellence stands as a testament to the boys'
dedication and camaraderie.</p>
<p>Our participation in BB Cares was especially meaningful, as we collaborated
with Yuying Secondary's BB to host a successful activity carnival for the
elderly at Compassvale. This initiative not only brought joy to the seniors
but also strengthened both companies' commitment to community service.</p>
<p>Despite the demands placed on them, the boys have consistently faced each
challenge with determination, overcoming physical and mental obstacles
together. Looking ahead, the Boys' Brigade remains committed to its motto,
"Sure &amp; Steadfast," dedicated to serving with compassion and pursuing
excellence.</p>
