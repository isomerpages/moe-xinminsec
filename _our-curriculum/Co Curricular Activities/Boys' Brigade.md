<h4><strong>45<sup>th</sup> Boys’ Brigade Company, Xinmin Secondary School</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>Boys' Brigade (BB) 45<sup>th </sup>&nbsp;Singapore Company at Xinmin Secondary School</strong> is
more than just a uniformed group — it is a family where boys grow into
self-disciplined leaders with an adventurous spirit and a heart for service.
For over 32 years, our Company has been shaping young men with the values
of obedience, reverence, discipline, self-respect, and leadership, equipping
them with essential skills and experiences that last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Our comprehensive programme challenges boys to step up as leaders through
adventure, discipline, and service. Every week, our members plan, lead,
and actively participate in activities that push them beyond their limits,
helping them grow in confidence and resilience in the process. Key highlights
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Badge-Work &amp; Skills Development</strong> – From first aid and
field cooking to advanced navigation and drills, boys pick up essential
life skills and values that prepare them for real-world challenges.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outdoor Adventures &amp; Team Bonding</strong> – Whether it’s camps,
kayaking, or overcoming fears together, our activities foster a spirit
of camaraderie and determination. We also keep things exciting with unique
experiences like laser tag, archery, k-pop dance, and rockclimbing!</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Service &amp; Leadership</strong> – The heart of the
Boys' Brigade lies in serving others. Through initiatives like Boys’ Brigade
Cares and BB Week, our boys learn the joy of giving back and mentoring
their juniors, preparing them to be future leaders.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As we look forward to another year of growth, we celebrate the dedication
of our mentors, volunteers, and alumni who make this journey possible.
With their support, our boys continue to <strong>learn, serve, and lead</strong>—shaping
not just themselves, but also the community around them.</p>
<p>Come <strong>be a part of this journey</strong> with us at the <strong>45th Boys' Brigade Company</strong>,
where every boy finds <strong>brotherhood, adventure, and purpose</strong>!</p>

<h4><strong>The Boys’ Brigade Development Programme (BDP)</strong></h4>
<p>The Boys’ Brigade Development Programme (BDP) is the 45th Singapore Company's
flagship leadership and talent development initiative, launched in 2025
to nurture future-ready Stewards grounded in character, service, and initiative.</p>
<p>BDP is a <strong>two-year programme</strong> for selected Secondary 1 and
2 Boys who demonstrate potential in leadership, teamwork, and contribution.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Boys who join the Company through the Direct School Admission (DSA) pathway
are automatically emplaced in the programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other Boys may apply through an annual application process, which includes
submitting their Xinmin e-Portfolio and attending an interview with the
Officer team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The programme is designed to cultivate Stewards with:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The heart to serve – by contributing meaningfully to the Company and school
community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initiative to lead – through structured opportunities to plan, speak,
and guide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character to grow – through self-reflection, peer interaction, and
personal ownership</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>BDP aims to develop Boys who are confident in their voice, committed to
values, and capable of making a positive difference in their squads, school,
and beyond.</p>
<p>At the end of their second year, Boys who complete the programme will:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Receive a certificate designating them as BDP Stewards and be formally
recognised for their growth at Company events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build essential leadership competencies that position them well for selection
into the NCO Council</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain meaningful experiences and develop strong values that can be showcased
in their Xinmin e-Portfolio as evidence of their leadership journey and
personal growth</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Excellence</strong></h4>
<p>This year, BB45th proudly celebrates three significant achievements. First,
the company’s inclusion in the BB Blaze Competition Gold Honour Roll highlights
the boys' resilience and teamwork in a physically challenging environment.
Additionally, two members were awarded the prestigious Founder’s Award,
recognizing their exemplary conduct and character. Furthermore, receiving
a High Distinction in the JM Fraser Award for Excellence stands as a testament
to the boys' dedication and camaraderie.</p>
<p>Our participation in BB Cares was especially meaningful, as we collaborated
with Yuying Secondary's BB to host a successful activity carnival for the
elderly at Compassvale. This initiative not only brought joy to the seniors
but also strengthened both companies' commitment to community service.</p>
<p>Despite the demands placed on them, the boys have consistently faced each
challenge with determination, overcoming physical and mental obstacles
together. Looking ahead, the Boys' Brigade remains committed to its motto,
"Sure &amp; Steadfast," dedicated to serving with compassion and pursuing
excellence.</p>
