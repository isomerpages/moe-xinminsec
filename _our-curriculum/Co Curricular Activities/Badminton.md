<p>Badminton is a demanding racquet sport which requires agility, strength,
power, speed and high mental endurance. In Xinmin Badminton Team (XMBT),
we strive to not only equip our players with proper badminton skills and
techniques; we also inculcate important values such as teamwork, resilience
and leadership in our players. Besides training hard and participating
in competitions, our players also get opportunities to plan and organise
events such as the Sec 1 Induction Programme, Xinmin Invitational Competition
for the primary school players, the N1 Cluster Games as well as our own
Annual Badminton Camp. These events provide excellent platforms for our
players to hone their leadership skills and to strengthen the bonds among
players in the team.</p>
