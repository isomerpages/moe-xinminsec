<div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 90%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Badminton" src="/images/Badminton.jpeg"></div><p>Badminton is a demanding racquet sport which requires agility, strength, power, speed and high mental endurance. In Xinmin Badminton Team (XMBT), we strive to not only equip our players with proper badminton skills and techniques; we also inculcate important values such as teamwork, resilience and leadership in our players. Besides training hard and participating in competitions, our players also get opportunities to plan and organise events such as the Sec 1 Induction Programme, Xinmin Invitational Competition for the primary school players, the N1 Cluster Games as well as our own Annual Badminton Camp. These events provide excellent platforms for our players to hone their leadership skills and to strengthen the bonds among players in the team.</p><p><strong>Accomplishments</strong><br>NSG Badminton Championships (North Zone) 2023:<br>‘B’ Division Girls : 3rd<br>‘C’ Division Girls : 3rd<br></p><p>NSG Badminton Championships (National) 2023:<br>‘B’ Division Girls : Top 16<br>‘C’ Division Girls : Top 8<br></p><p><strong>Teachers-in-charge</strong><br>Mr Lim Kok Chong (IC)<br>Ms Anny Roezza Abdul Aziz<br>Mdm Annie Tan<br>Ms Siaw Pei Shin<br>Ms Noor Hafizah<br></p><p><strong>Student Leaders</strong><br>‘B’ Division Captains: Lim En Qi (301, 2023)<br>‘B’ Division Vice-Captains: Fong Jia Qi (303, 2023)<br>‘C’ Division Captains: Venus Tay Yu Xi (205, 2023)<br>‘C’ Division Vice-Captains: Ng Xi Yuan, Sylvie (204, 2023)<br></p><p><strong>CCA Schedule</strong><br>C Div - Monday, Wednesday 1530h to 1830h, Friday 1330h to 1630h<br>B Div - Tuesday, Wednesday 1530h to 1830h, Friday 1330h to 1630h<br></p><p><strong>Instagram</strong><br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/xms.badminton/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/xms.badminton/</a></p>
