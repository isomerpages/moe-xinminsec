<p><strong><em>"Let’s smash goals together and build a legacy of teamwork and skill."</em></strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Badminton Team!</strong></h4>
<p>Badminton is a challenging sport that demands agility, strength, speed,
and mental endurance. At Xinmin Badminton Team (XMBT), we not only focus
on honing our players' skills and techniques but also emphasize the importance
of values such as teamwork, resilience, and leadership.</p>
<p>Beyond training and competitions, our players have the opportunity to
plan and organise events like the Secondary 1 Induction Programme, the
Xinmin Invitational Competition for primary school students, and our Annual
Badminton Camp. These experiences provide a platform for them to develop
leadership skills and strengthen team bonds, shaping them into well-rounded
individuals both on and off the court.</p>

They develop their leadership abilities by taking charge of warm-ups, training
sessions, and competitive matches, while also leading debriefs. Additionally,

and Induction Programs, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience for all
involved.</p>
