Despite the short amount of time available to train the young enthusiasts who mostly have little or no prior exposure to band music, Xinmin Concert Band has always been passionate and sincere in educating and training its young musicians. Through hard work and dedication, the members continuously strive to achieve the high standards set by their predecessors through their practices and sectionals. They have also clinched prestigious awards, particularly at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for concert bands – Distinction award for year 2013, 2015, 2017, 2023.

The Xinmin Concert Band performs a diverse range of musical pieces from simple ensemble pieces to highly acclaimed and technically demanding band works transcribed from famous musicals, operas and orchestral work in our school Xinmin Arts Week. The Band was also honoured to be invited to perform at the Istana for the Open House in 2022.

Under the musical direction of our band maestro, Mr Daniel Kiang, and the ongoing guidance from nurturing and caring band teachers, the Band has grown from strength to strength, and will continue to soar to greater artistic heights to captivate our audiences with our vibrant performances.
