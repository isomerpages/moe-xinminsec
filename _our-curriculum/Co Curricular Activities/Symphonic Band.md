<h4><strong>Welcome to the Xinmin Symphonic Band!</strong></h4>
<p>The Xinmin Symphonic Band is deeply committed to educating and training
its young musicians with passion and sincerity. Through hard work and dedication,
members continually strive to meet the high standards established by their
predecessors through rigorous practices and sectionals. Under the expert
musical direction of our band maestros, Mr. Daniel Kiang and Ms. Leong
Tjar Ngee, along with the ongoing support from our dedicated band teachers,
the ensemble has grown stronger, achieving remarkable artistic heights.</p>
<p>The Xinmin Symphonic Band has earned prestigious awards, particularly
at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for concert bands, receiving
Distinction awards in 2015, 2017, 2023 and 2025. During our annual Xinmin
Arts Week (Xinfony), the Band performs a diverse array of musical pieces,
ranging from simple ensemble works to highly acclaimed and technically
demanding compositions transcribed from renowned musicals, operas, and
orchestral pieces. The Band has also had the honour of participating in
various school events, including Speech Day and National Day celebrations,
as well as external performances such as Schools In Concert and the Junior
Band Festival, where they showcased their remarkable talents and captivated
audiences.</p>
