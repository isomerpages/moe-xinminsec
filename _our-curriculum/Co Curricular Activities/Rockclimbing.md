<p><strong>“The ascent is as important as the view”</strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Rock-Climbing (XRC)!</strong></h4>
<p>Xinmin Rockclimbing takes pride in being one of the few rock-climbing
CCAs among secondary schools in Singapore. Over four years, our climbers
have the opportunity to learn and excel in all three climbing disciplines—bouldering,
top rope (lead), and speed.</p>
<p>The journey of growth doesn’t stop at climbing. Our climbers gain valuable
skills beyond the wall through organising competitions, teaching introductory
bouldering workshops, and expanding their horizons through overseas trips!
Here’s a glimpse of what we do:</p>

<h4><strong>Leadership Development:</strong></h4>
<p>While we have an Executive Committee (EXCO), every climber is provided
with opportunities to develop their leadership potential through various
activities throughout the year. This includes opportunities such as being
a part of the planning committee for Open House, CCA Orientation, as well
as various competitions organised by the CCA. The EXCO is responsible for
managing the club’s day-to-day operations, assisting teachers with administrative
tasks, and ensuring that the entire team puts forth their best effort during
training sessions and competitions.</p>

<h4><strong>Excellence:</strong></h4>
<p>Our members regularly participate in competitions throughout the year,
striving to excel and bring glory to the school. These competitions pit
our climbers against participants from all over Singapore and sometimes
even internationally. Despite competing against more experienced climbers,
our members consistently showcase the strength and resilience that Xinmin
students are known for.</p>
<h4><strong>Accomplishments</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>Community Engagement:</strong></h4>
<p>In addition to competing, our climbers give back to the community by organising
competitions for others and running introductory workshops. We take pride
in the fact that learning within the CCA extends beyond technical climbing
skills to include vital soft skills such as teamwork and communication.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, our members conduct an introductory bouldering
workshop for all Secondary 1 students during their Sec 1 Orientation. This
experience allows the newcomers to get a taste of bouldering, with some
deciding to pursue the sport further with us or on their own.</p>
<p>The team collaborates with an external vendor to organise the Inter-Schools
Bouldering Championships, where they take on various auxiliary roles such
as registration, safety oversight, and emceeing. Through this event, they
gain valuable insights into the behind-the-scenes efforts required to organise
competitions, fostering appreciation for those who go the extra mile.</p>
<p>Building on these experiences, our climbers are now equipped to run their
own competition — in partnership with Hougang Primary School, we are the
proud co-organisers of X-calade, a novice category in the National Primary
Schools Sport Climbing Championships (NPSSCC). X-calade sees over 100 primary
school students taking part in this competition, with our team taking full
responsibility for all aspects, including auxiliary tasks, route judging,
and score tallying.</p>
<p>Through these initiatives, our climbers actively engage the school community
and beyond, fostering a love for the sport while honing their individual
soft skills.</p>
<p>We believe that every climb presents an opportunity for learning. Join
us as we work to instil key values in our climbers — perseverance, teamwork,
resilience, and a mindset of excellence for both sports and life!</p>
