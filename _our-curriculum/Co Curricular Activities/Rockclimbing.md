Our belief has always been to develop core values like perseverance and discipline in our team members. These core values are continually emphasised in both training and competition. We also strive to develop teamwork, camaraderie and leadership in our members by providing various opportunities for our students to excel.</p><p>Over the course of their journey with Xinmin Rock Climbing, our climbers will learn basic climbing skills across three disciplines – bouldering, top rope, and lead climbing. They will take part in competitions and even organise their own – Xinmin Secondary School has been the proud organiser of the Inter Schools Bouldering Championships (ISBC) and primary school carnival X-calade. We welcomed about 200 competitors across the 'A,' 'B' and 'C' Divisions and were heartened by the success of the event. In 2023, we resumed X-calade and collaborated with Hougang Primary School to incorporate it into their National Primary Schools Sport Climbing Championships roster.</p><p>As part of our efforts to expose our students to more aspects of climbing, we send them for various competitions across the three disciplines. Additionally, every two years, our students will get the chance to travel overseas on rock climbing trips where they will get to climb on natural rock.</p><p>In 2024, we look forward to the resumption of overseas trips and more competitions as well. We also anticipate welcoming the next generation of passionate and driven climbers.</p><p><strong>Accomplishments</strong><br>Inter Schools Bouldering Championships (ISBC) 2023<br>C Div Girls - Team 1st, Rachelle Tok (103) Individual 5th<br>C Div Boys - Team 2nd, Jacob Ee (201) Individual 3rd<br>B Div Girls - Team 2nd, Rin Low (406) Individual 3rd<br>B Div Boys - Team 3rd, Owen Chan (406) Individual 3rd, Chan Hong Yu (404) Individual 5th<br></p><p><strong>Teachers-in-charge</strong><br>Ms Hazirah Bte Mohamad Helmy (IC)<br>Mr Kevin Lu Wenqi<br>Ms Lim Yen Peng<br>Ms Liew Ziyi<br></p><p><strong>Student Leaders</strong><br>B Division:<br>Clarisse Lim (303, 2023) - Captain<br>Goh Wan Ting (303, 2023) - Vice-Captain<br>Ennya Lim (306, 2023) - Vice-Captain<br>Nur Zarifah (306, 2023) - Team Manager<br>Kyler Lee (301, 2023) - Team Manager<br></p><p>C Division:<br>Albert Yaw (203, 2023) - Co-Captain<br>Alfred Yaw (204, 2023) - Co-Captain<br>Benedict Chen (204, 2023) - Team Manager<br>Valerie Loh (201, 2023) - Quartermaster<br>Sanghvi Dhara (202, 2023) - Publicity IC<br></p><p><strong>CCA Schedule</strong><br>Wednesdays: 3.30 - 6.30 pm<br>Fridays: 2.15 - 6.00 pm<br>*CCA might sometimes be conducted at various climbing gyms outside school<br></p><p><strong>Instagram</strong><br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/xmsrockclimbing/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/xmsrockclimbing/</a></p>
