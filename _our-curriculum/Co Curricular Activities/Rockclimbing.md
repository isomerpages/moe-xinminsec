<p><strong>“The ascent is as important as the view”</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Rock-Climbing (XRC)!</strong>
</p>
<p>Xinmin Rockclimbing takes pride in being one of the few rock-climbing
CCAs among secondary schools in Singapore. Over four years, our climbers
have the opportunity to learn and excel in all three climbing disciplines—bouldering,
top rope (lead), and speed.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t stop at climbing. Our climbers gain valuable skills beyond
the wall by organizing competitions, teaching introductory bouldering workshops,
and expanding their horizons through overseas trips! Here’s a glimpse of
what we do:</p>
<p><strong>Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Competitions organised by rock climbing gyms
(e.g. Inter-Schools Bouldering League, Sparks, Sendstorm)</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organising competitions (Inter-Schools Bouldering
Championships and X-Calade)</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting certifications (Singapore National
Climbing Standards Levels 1 and 2)</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overseas climbing trips (Malaysia, Thailand)</p>
<p><strong>CCA Schedule</strong>
<br>Wednesdays: 3:30pm to 6.30pm
<br>Fridays: 2.30pm to 6pm</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Development:</strong>
</p>
<p>While we have an Executive Committee, every climber is provided with opportunities
to develop their leadership potential through various activities throughout
the year. This includes planning for Open House and CCA Orientation, organizing
competitions, and engaging in other essential activities. The EXCO is responsible
for managing the club’s day-to-day operations, assisting teachers with
administrative tasks, and ensuring that the entire team puts forth their
best effort during training sessions and competitions.</p>

<p><strong>Excellence:</strong>
<br>Our members regularly participate in competitions throughout the year,
striving to bring glory to the school. These competitions pit our climbers
against participants from all over Singapore and sometimes even internationally.
Despite competing against more experienced climbers, our members consistently
showcase the strength and resilience that Xinmin students are known for.</p>

<p><strong>Community Engagement:</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to competing, our climbers give back to the community by organizing
competitions for others and running introductory workshops. We take pride
in the fact that learning within the CCA extends beyond technical climbing
skills to include vital soft skills such as teamwork and communication.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, our members conduct an introductory bouldering
workshop for all Secondary 1 students during their Sec 1 Orientation. This
experience allows the newcomers to get a taste of bouldering, with some
deciding to pursue the sport further with us or on their own.</p>
<p>The team collaborates with an external vendor to organize the Inter-Schools
Bouldering Championships, where they take on various auxiliary roles such
as registration, safety oversight, and emceeing. Through this event, they
gain valuable insights into the behind-the-scenes efforts required to organize
competitions, fostering appreciation for those who go the extra mile.</p>
<p>Building on these experiences, our climbers are now equipped to run their
own competition—X-calade, a novice category in the National Primary Schools
Sport Climbing Championships (NPSSCC), in partnership with Hougang Primary
School. They host over 100 primary school students for this competition,
taking full responsibility for all aspects, including auxiliary tasks,
route judging, and score tallying.</p>
<p>Through these initiatives, our climbers actively engage the school community
and beyond, fostering a love for the sport while honing their individual
soft skills.</p>
<p>We believe that every climb presents an opportunity for learning. Join
us as we work to instil key values in our climbers—perseverance, teamwork,
resilience, and a mindset of excellence for both sports and life!</p>
