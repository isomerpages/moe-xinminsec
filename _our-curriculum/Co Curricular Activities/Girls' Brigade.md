These include both indoor and outdoor activities such as handicrafts, outreach to the community, outdoor cooking and learning journeys around Singapore.</p><p>Through the girls’ four years in Girls’ Brigade, our programme aims to develop the social, educational, spiritual, and physical aspects of every girl so that they will learn important life skills and be well equipped to take on any challenges in life.</p><p>In 2022, our company represented the Girls’ Brigade Singapore at the National Day Parade marching contingent in recognition of our good CCA track record and contributions. Following that in 2023, our girls won a Gold award for the GB Drill Competition.
