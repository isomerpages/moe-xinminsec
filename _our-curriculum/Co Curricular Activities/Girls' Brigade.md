<h4><strong>Welcome to the Girls’ Brigade, 42<sup>nd</sup> company!</strong></h4>
<p>The Girls’ Brigade (GB) 42nd Company is dedicated to nurturing and empowering
young women, equipping them with the skills and confidence to grow into
leaders. Our mission is to cultivate every Girl as a leader and every Officer
as a Servant Leader, helping them reach their fullest potential by providing
opportunities to lead, learn, and serve.</p>
<p>We offer a well-rounded selection of activities, from camps, drills, and
badgework, to leadership opportunities that span both indoor and outdoor
environments. Whether it’s crafting, community outreach, outdoor cooking,
or exploring learning journeys around Singapore, our diverse programmes
allow the girls to plan, lead, and actively participate in meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>Throughout their four years with Girls’ Brigade, our girls embark on a
journey of personal development, building their social, educational, spiritual,
and physical skills. Our aim is to equip them with the life skills they
need to overcome challenges and thrive in every aspect of life.</p>

<h4><strong>2024 Awards:</strong></h4>
<p>This year, our company proudly participated in the GB Tech Girl badgework,
where the girls gained programming skills by coding with the micro: bit.
This was conducted alongside the biannual Dr Low Guat Tin Challenge, under
the theme "Better Together, for a Better Tomorrow." The challenge encouraged
empathy and creativity as our girls designed innovative solutions to support
the elderly and other vulnerable groups in Singapore. We are proud to share
that our girls excelled in the competition, showcasing their dedication
and ingenuity.</p>
<p>We are also thrilled to celebrate the achievements of three of our girls
who earned the prestigious Pioneer Brigadier Brooch, the pinnacle award
