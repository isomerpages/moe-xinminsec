<p>Our Executive Committee leaders play a crucial role in guiding the club’s
growth and direction. They sharpen their leadership skills by leading major
initiatives such as Xin-play, which fosters dynamic partnerships with primary
schools. They also oversee key events like Art Jamming sessions, Open House,
and the Secondary 1 CCA orientation, ensuring new students feel welcomed
through creative bonding activities and immersive arts programs.</p>
<p>In collaboration with our members, these leaders also organize the Upcycling
Competition for Secondary 1 students. This event not only teaches the principles
of upcycling but also inspires participants to create innovative and practical
upcycled products.</p>

<p><strong>Artistic Excellence:</strong>
<br>Members of XAC take pride in representing our school in a variety of arts
competitions, continually refining their artistic skills and creative expression.
We actively engage in art initiatives, seizing every opportunity to showcase
our talents through projects such as wall mural designs, the Xinmin Design
Fiesta Ball Run Out competition, and other captivating artwork displays.
Most recently, we made a significant impact by hosting our very own Art
Club exhibition at Reflections Theatre during Homecoming Day, leaving a
lasting impression on our school's vibrant artistic community.</p>
<strong>Accomplishments</strong>
<br>a) Arts sharing with PCF Sparkletots Hougang
<br>b) Upcycling Art level competition<br>
c) Live on art competition<br>
d) Avatar Art Competition
<p><strong>Community Engagement:</strong>
<br>Beyond our school, XAC actively engages with the broader community, regularly
participating in events such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) art
labs and various art workshops. These opportunities allow our members to
gain valuable exposure, collaborate with fellow artists, and broaden their
creative perspectives.</p>
<p>In Term 3, we formed a partnership to design community-based dustbins,
contributing to the vibrancy of the Hougang neighbourhood through art.</p>
<p>Xinmin Art Club is more than just a club; it's a dynamic community where
ideas are exchanged, friendships are built, and creativity thrives. From
camps, art workshops, and museum visits to Co-Curricular Activity Orientations
and partnerships with community organizations, our members actively enrich
the school environment while exploring the limitless world of art.</p>
<p>Join us on our artistic journey at XAC, where creativity has no boundaries,
and the pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong adventure. Together, we explore
new possibilities, create meaningful art, and inspire one another!</p>
