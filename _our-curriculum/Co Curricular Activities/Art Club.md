<br>Our Executive-committee leaders play a pivotal role in shaping the club's
journey. They hone their leadership skills by spearheading our key programs,
including Xin-play, dynamic partnerships with primary schools, and a cherished
arts collaboration with Sparkletots. They also lead initiatives like Open
House and Secondary 1 CCA orientation programs, ensuring a warm welcome
for new students through bonding activities and engaging arts programs.
Creative Collaboration:</p>
<p>Our leaders and members join forces to organize the Upcycling Competition
for Secondary 1 students in the second term. This competition not only
teaches the art of upcycling but also encourages participants to design
innovative and useful upcycled products.</p>
<p><strong>Artistic Excellence:</strong>
<br>Members of XAC proudly represent our school in various arts competitions,
refining their artistic talents and flair. We actively participate in art
initiatives, embracing opportunities to showcase our creativity in projects
like wall mural designs and captivating artworks. Most recently, we hosted
our Art Club Art exhibition at Reflections Theatre during Homecoming Day,
leaving an indelible mark on our school's artistic landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Community Engagement:</strong>
<br>Beyond our school walls, XAC seeks to engage with the wider community.
We regularly participate in events such as the Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) art labs and various art workshops. These experiences enable our
members to gain exposure, learn from fellow artists, and expand their artistic
horizons.</p>
<p>Xinmin Art Club is not just a club; it's a vibrant community where ideas
are shared, friendships are forged, and creativity knows no bounds. Whether
through camps, art workshops, museum visits, Co-curricular Activity Orientations,
or our partnerships with community organizations, our members actively
contribute to the school while enjoying the boundless world of art.</p>
<p>Join us on our artistic journey at XAC, where creativity knows no limits,
and learning is a lifelong adventure. Together, we explore, create, and
inspire!</p>
