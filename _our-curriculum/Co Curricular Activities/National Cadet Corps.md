The Xinmin National Cadet Corps (NCC) is a dynamic and rugged where there are ample opportunities for cadets to participate in a wide range of activities. Leadership programmes are also in place to groom promising cadets to be future leaders. Activities are conducted at both school and HQ levels. Through these activities, Xinmin NCC seeks to nurture cadets into resilient, disciplined, committed, and responsible individuals.

These are some of the activities in which our cadets participate each year:

Sec 1 Cadets: Kayaking Orientation Programme, Camp FORGE
Sec 2 Cadets: 1-Star Kayaking Proficiency, Individual Marksmanship Training (IMT), Orienteering Competition, Self-Defence, Camp STEEL
Sec 3 Cadets: 2-Star Kayaking Proficiency, Self-Defence, SAR 21 Live-Firing

To hone the leadership skills of our cadet leaders, our Sec 3 cadets are given the responsibility to organise, plan and conduct the unit’s weekly training programmes which include Foot drills, Arms drills, Precision Drill Squad (PDS) training, Individual Field Craft (IFC), Orienteering and Physical Training. They are also given the opportunity to plan the annual camp which aims to build camaraderie among the cadets.
