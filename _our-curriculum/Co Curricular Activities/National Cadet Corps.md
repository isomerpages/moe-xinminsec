<p><strong>Welcome to NCC!</strong>
</p>
<p>The Xinmin National Cadet Corps (NCC) offers a dynamic and demanding Co-Curricular
Activity (CCA) that cultivates resilience, discipline, and leadership among
its cadets. The program provides numerous opportunities for cadets to engage
in a wide range of activities at both the school and HQ levels. Participants
attend HQ camps, where they develop essential survival skills and take
part in exciting activities like paintball, abseiling, and ziplining. Additionally,
cadets have the opportunity to engage in SAR 21 live range shooting and
represent their unit in sports championships and laser run competitions.</p>
