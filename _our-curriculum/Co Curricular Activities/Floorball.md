<p><strong>Brothers, first always, Xinmin!</strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Floorball team!</strong></h4>
<p>Established in 2022, the Floorball CCA at Xinmin Secondary has quickly
grown into a dynamic and tightly knit team. From its humble beginnings
as a small group of passionate players, the team has rapidly evolved into
a strong, cohesive unit, dedicated not only to excelling in the sport but
also to fostering an inclusive and supportive environment for all members.</p>
<p>The players' commitment to their training and teamwork has been key to
this remarkable progress. Along the way, they have sharpened their individual
skills while also gaining a deep appreciation for collaboration both on
and off the court. This sense of unity has become the team’s foundation,
propelling them to constantly push their limits and strive for excellence
in every game and practice session.</p>
<p>As the team continues to grow, so too does their bond, creating a motivating
atmosphere where every member is encouraged to give their best. The Floorball
CCA exemplifies the power of teamwork and perseverance, and the future
looks exceptionally bright for this talented group of athletes.</p>

<h4><strong>Leadership Development:</strong></h4>
<p>Our Executive-committee leaders play a crucial role in shaping the floorball
experience. They develop their leadership skills by taking charge of key
initiatives, such as organising the 3 vs 3 Primary School Tournament, and
by setting a positive example during training sessions. These leaders also
spearhead programs like the Open House and Secondary 1 CCA Orientation,
ensuring a warm and engaging welcome for new students with exciting floorball
activities and bonding exercises.</p>
