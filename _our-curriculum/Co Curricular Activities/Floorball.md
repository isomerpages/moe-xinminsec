<p><strong>Brothers, first always, Xinmin!</strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Floorball team!</strong></h4>
<p>Established in 2022, our team has rapidly expanded from a handful of passionate
players into a strong, cohesive unit. While we take pride in competing
with heart and discipline, floorball at Xinmin is about much more than
the game. It is where character is built, brotherhood is forged, and every
player learns to take ownership of his growth, with the assurance of support
from his teammates, teachers and coach.</p>
<p>Through consistent training and commitment, our boys sharpen their individual
skills while learning the value of collaboration, resilience, and respect.
Each training session is not just about drills and tactics, but about pushing
one another to be better — as players, as students and as people. Every
member matters, and every member contributes to the spirit that drives
us forward.</p>

<h4><strong>Leadership Development:</strong></h4>
<p>Leadership is an important part of our journey. Our leaders in the Executive
Committee guide the team by organising key initiatives such as the 3v3
Primary School Tournament and the Xinmin Royale. They also take the lead
in welcoming new members at events like the Open House and Secondary 1
CCA Orientation, ensuring every newcomer feels part of the team from day
one.</p>
<p>At the same time, leadership is not limited to the committee. Every player
is given the chance to lead in different ways — from helping to plan bonding
activities to taking on rotating captaincy roles in matches outside the
National School Games. These experiences allow every player to grow in
confidence, responsibility, and service, while learning how to support
and inspire others.</p>
<p>In every role they take on, be it leading warm-ups, mentoring juniors,
or representing the team on court, we aim to grow our boys’ confidence,
responsibility, and service. These opportunities help them to discover
their strengths, set an example for others, and carry the Xinmin spirit
forward.</p>

<h4><strong>Excellence:</strong></h4>
<p>Xinmin’s Floorball members proudly represent the school in the National
School Games and other competitions. Beyond results, we see every match,
from friendly games to tournaments like Pesta Sukan, as an opportunity
to sharpen our skills, learn new gameplay strategies, and grow together
as a team.</p>
<p>For the third year running, we hosted our annual 3v3 Primary School Tournament
during the June holidays, giving aspiring young players a chance to experience
the thrill of floorball. The tournament also serves as a meaningful introduction
for those considering floorball as their future CCA, while strengthening
the bonds within our own team.</p>
