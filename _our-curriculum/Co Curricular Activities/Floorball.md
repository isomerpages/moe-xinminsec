<p>Floorball for boys is a new CCA introduced in Xinmin from 2022. It is
a fast-paced indoor sport played using a ball and a stick. Floorball’s
popularity has grown all over the world, including in Singapore where many
post – secondary tertiary institutions have it as their CCA as well. The
game is played with five outfield players and a goalkeeper from each team.
It is physically demanding, requires teamwork and tests players’ ability
to think and react fast.</p>
<p>Even though the objective of sports is to win, the Xinmin Floorball teachers
and coaches believe that it is more important to focus on the students’
character first before focusing on developing the necessary knowledge and
skills needed for the game. Under the guidance of teachers and coach, we
aspire to develop the Xinmin Floorball players to be sportsman grounded
in good values and with a mindset for excellence.</p>
