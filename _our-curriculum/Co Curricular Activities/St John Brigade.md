<div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:90%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="St. John Brigade" src="/images/SJB.jpeg"></div><p>In St. John Brigade (SJB), cadets participate in a myriad of activities such as home nursing, hospital attachment, camping, outdoor activities and more, over the course of 4 years. Cadets undergo continual upgrading of their first aid skills and knowledge during weekly trainings. This enables them to assist in rendering first aid during school and public events. At the time of each cadetâ€™s graduation from Xinmin Secondary, s/he would have attained, at least, Certification in Basic First Aid and/or Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) + Automated External Defibrillator (AED).</p><p>Beyond acquiring skills that our cadets can use during critical situations, SJB provides an important platform for them to relate to their peers through problem-solving and teambuilding. Cadets also take turns to lead their peers during weekly trainings so as to improve on their communication skills. The activities and challenges in SJB aim to contribute to the holistic growth of the cadets so that they may become outgoing and confident leaders who are physically and socially active; who learn to not only work well in teams, but also to extend their reach to positively impact society.</p><p>It is the high standards and continuous commitment of our student leaders, youth officers, and teachers that led SJB to bag its 22nd Gold for the Corps Achievement Award since 2001.</p><p><strong>Accomplishments</strong><br>CCA Achievement<br>Gold for Corps Achievement Award (2022)<br></p><p><strong>Teachers-in-charge</strong><br>Ms Nur Amalina Bte Mohamed Zain (IC)<br>Ms Koh Cher Yee<br></p><p><strong>Student Leaders</strong><br>Corps Sergeant Major (CSM): Peh Yi Xin Tiffany (306)<br>Assistant Corps Sergeant Major (ACSM): Lim Kai En Jadan (303)<br>Platoon Sergeant 1: Quek Pei Rong Valen (308)<br>Platoon Sergeant 2: Soh Si Ning, Shannon (202), Jaeden Chin (203)<br>Platoon Sergeant 3: Justyn Lin Guang Wei (308)<br></p><p>Publicity Head: Chan Wen Yi Jolene (303)<br>Logistics Head: Angela Leong Mun Shuen (305)<br>Cadet Development Head: Poa Wen Jun Wesley (309)<br></p><p><strong>CCA Schedule</strong><br>Wednesdays: 4pm to 6pm<br>Fridays: 2pm to 6pm </p><p>Selected Saturday<br></p><p><strong>Instagram</strong><br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/xmsstjohn/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/xmsstjohn/</a></p>
