<p><strong>Welcome to Xinmin St John Brigade!</strong>
</p>
<p>At Xinmin St. John Brigade, we are dedicated to nurturing resilient and
compassionate leaders who are prepared to create a positive impact in the
community. Our Cadet program equips members with essential First Aid and
Home Nursing skills while fostering leadership development. Through community
service and the Cadet Proficiency Badge Schemes, cadets gain hands-on experience
and explore their personal interests. Guided by the motto “For the Service
of Mankind,” our cadets strive to embody the values of service, empathy,
and excellence in all their endeavours.</p>
<p>The high standards and unwavering dedication of our student leaders, youth
officers, and teachers have earned the Xinmin St. John Brigade its 23rd
consecutive Gold in the Corps Achievement Award since 2001.</p>

<p><strong>Leadership Development:</strong>
</p>
<p>After completing both the Basic and Advanced Non-Commissioned Officer
courses, our cadets are empowered with the skills and knowledge to effectively
plan and organize corps activities. Under the guidance of our alumni and
officers, our cadet leaders play a crucial role in shaping and executing
corps events and weekly activities. Those who demonstrate a passion for
teaching first aid, home nursing, or foot drill have opportunities to attend
HQ instructor courses, enabling them to take the lead in these areas within
the corps. Our corps leaders collaborate closely with other uniformed groups,
such as NCC, BB, and GB, to organize inter-uniformed group activities like
the Passing Out Parade and inter-UG hikes.</p>

<p><strong>Community Engagement:</strong>
<br>Our cadets provide first aid support for school activities, including
Cross-Country and various level activities. In 2024, they had the valuable
opportunity to extend their service beyond the school by participating
in the Metta Race 2024, thereby enhancing their community engagement and
applying their skills in a real-world context.</p>
<p>Join us on our leadership journey and make a meaningful difference in
our community!</p>
