<p>In Xinmin, we believe in giving our students a holistic education and
CCAs play a big role in shaping our students’ secondary school experience.
As the world increasingly becomes a more complex place to live in, CCAs
play a critical role in preparing our students with human skills, grounded
in core values. They provide our students with the opportunity to pursue
their interests and acquire knowledge and skills. As a common space for
students of diverse backgrounds to socialise, close friendships are forged
as students journey through their experiences together for 4 to 5 years
in Xinmin.</p>
<p>Our CCAs have always performed consistently well. Our Sports CCAs regularly
qualify for the National rounds from the zonal stages in the National School
Games, giving our athletes the chance to compete against the best amongst
their peers. Our Visual and Performing Arts CCAs always strive to awe the
audience during their public performances. At the biennial Singapore Youth
Festival Arts Presentation, more often than not, they will achieve a distinction.
Our Uniformed Groups, in their various Unit Competitions, consistently
bags the Gold or Silver awards, affirming their efforts in developing our
students to be rugged and resilient individuals. Last but not the least,
our Clubs and Societies CCAs are recognized for their efforts in giving
students a varied CCA experience as well as providing quality service for
the school. While Xinmin strives to sustain these successes, the key focus
of our CCAs is still the emphasis on character building and the belief
that the journey is more important than the destination. Our teachers,
coaches and volunteers play an active role in their respective CCAs to
provide students with a meaningful CCA experience. However this must be
complemented with students having a resilient mindset and a positive attitude.
Parents also play an important role in reinforcing these values at home
and hence it is our sincere hope that parents will partner the school and
provide the support required so that every student can be an active contributor
in his or her co – curricular journey in Xinmin.</p>

<h2>1.&nbsp;LEAPS 2.0 – A Recognition System</h2>
<p>To provide students with a holistic and well-rounded experience in the
co-curriculum, the Ministry of Education (MOE) introduced the LEAPS 2.0
framework in secondary schools. LEAPS 2.0 has 4 domains as follow:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Participation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achievement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework serves to recognise a secondary school students’ holistic
development. Students will be recognised with levels of attainment in the
four domains.</p>
<p><strong>Participation</strong>: This domain recognises students’ participation
in one school-based Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). Recognition is based
on the number of years of participation and exemplary conduct and active
contribution to the CCA. Sustained engagement in the same CCA allows for
progressive development of character, skills, knowledge and friendships,
and will be accorded higher recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong>: This domain recognises students’ development
as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community.
Every secondary school student will contribute at least 6 hours per school
year to the community. They can choose to embark on a Values-In-Action
project (VIA). Students will be recognised for the time they put into planning,
service and reflection, when participating in a VIA project.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership</strong>: This domain recognises students’ leadership
development. Recognition is accorded to students’ ability to take charge
of personal development, work in a team and assume responsibilities in
service of others. In addition to formal leadership appointments, participation
in student leadership modules/workshops, the National Youth Achievement
Award (NYAA) and leadership positions in the school, CCA or student-initiated/student-led
projects will also be recognised.</p>
<p><strong>Achievement</strong>: This domain recognises students’ representation
and accomplishment in co-curricular involvements beyond the classroom.
Opportunities for representation and accomplishment present valuable learning
experiences for students to learn discipline, resilience and develop their
character.</p>
<h2>Recognition of Students’ Level of Attainment</h2>
<p>At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment
will be recognised according to Excellent/Good/Fair. The level of attainment
will be converted to a bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to
Junior Colleges/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of Technical Education (JC/Poly/ITE).
Please refer to individual admission criteria of JC, Poly and ITE for specific
details.</p>
