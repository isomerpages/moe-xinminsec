<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Cross Country!</strong></h4>
<p>Cross Country as a CCA nurtures students’ holistic development, helping
them grow both physically and mentally. Through running, students not only
learn important values but also shape their character, unlocking their
full potential while cultivating a passion for the sport. This development
extends beyond athletics, positively impacting their academic pursuits
by fostering discipline and resilience. The CCA provides opportunities
for student-led initiatives, allowing members to take ownership, practice
self-direction, and develop their socio-emotional competencies. The team,
comprising both boys and girls, proudly represents Xinmin Secondary School
at the National School Games, while also participating in public open running
events.</p>
<p>Our Executive-Committee leaders play an essential role in guiding the
CCA’s direction. They enhance their leadership skills by leading warmups,
organizing workouts, and conducting debrief sessions. These student leaders
are also entrusted with planning the team bonding camp and taking charge
of initiatives like Open House and Secondary 1 CCA Orientation, ensuring
new students feel welcomed through engaging bonding and fitness activities.</p>
