<p><strong>Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Improvise, Adapt, Overcome</strong>
</p>
<p>The Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC) is dedicated to cultivating confident,
self-reliant adventure leaders who possess a strong sense of social responsibility.
Safety and discipline are fundamental to all our activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ODAC provides members with exciting opportunities to explore the great
outdoors, nurturing strong friendships and teamwork in natural environments.
Whether hiking scenic trails, camping, or kayaking, there’s an adventure
for everyone to enjoy and experience. Through challenging local and overseas
activities, members collaborate to exercise both leadership and followership
while embracing inclusiveness. Experiencing the outdoors firsthand in unfamiliar
settings not only fosters adaptability but also deepens respect for nature.
Our objectives are captured in ODAC’s motto: "Improvise, Adapt, Overcome."
