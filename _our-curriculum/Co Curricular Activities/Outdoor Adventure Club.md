ODAC members, while engaging in challenging and adventurous local or overseas activities, work together in small groups to exercise leadership and equally important, followership, practise inclusiveness, learn the value of working towards a common goal and recognise the unique attributes each individual brings to the team. These objectives/practices are exemplified by ODAC’s motto: Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.

While exploring their own strengths and weaknesses, ODAC members realise how overcoming self-imposed limitations can bring success even in the most challenging of situations. This enhances their ability to bounce back from setbacks or challenges with confidence and optimism. Members also learn that risk can be dealt with responsibly and cautiously – a lesson that can be applied to their own personal situations. To help transfer their learning to everyday context, students are guided to reflect on how they might approach a similar situation again.

Personal experience in a variety of outdoor settings also helps them to feel more comfortable in the great outdoors. Learning first-hand in a non-familiar outdoor environment not only allows them to develop adaptability, but also respect for the natural world as well.

Finally, on the most basic level, ODAC gets every member to practise simple physical exercise, healthy living (or is it lifestyle?) habits and an opportunity for members to interact and build strong relationships away from the usual classroom environment.
