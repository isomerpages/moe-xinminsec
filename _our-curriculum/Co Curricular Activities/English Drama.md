<h4><strong>Welcome to English Drama Club! üé≠‚ú®</strong></h4>
<p>The English Drama Club kicked off the year with intense preparations for
Xinmin Arts Week in April. Our members were fully immersed in rehearsals
for two original plays written by our own talented students: <em>Fragile Reflections</em> by
Layla and Laura, and <em>The Moon Represents Our Hearts</em> by Alyssa and
Isaac. The journey was challenging, with moments of exhaustion and pressure,
but we pushed through together. The plays turned out to be remarkable,
delivering powerful narratives and meaningful lessons. Both productions
hold a special place in our hearts, as they were pivotal in the growth
and development of our members. We were thrilled to perform <em>The Moon Represents Our Hearts</em> again
at the N1 Cluster Spin A Tale event in May, though it was bittersweet as
it marked the official farewell to our beloved Sec 4 members. We wish them
a rewarding journey ahead and hope they continue to pursue their passion
for drama at a higher level!</p>
<p>While we bid farewell to our graduating members, the journey for the rest
of the Drama Club is just beginning. We are now gearing up for the biennial
Singapore Youth Festival 2025, and our members are committed to putting
their best foot forward and making Xinmin proud. Together, we‚Äôll face the
road ahead with determination and creativity. And with that, we say, ‚ÄúDrama,
that's a wrap!‚Äù</p>
