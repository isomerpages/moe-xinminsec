<h4><strong>Welcome to English Drama Club! 🎭✨</strong></h4>
<p>The English Drama Club began the year with preparations for the Singapore
Youth Festival (SYF) 2025. Everyone worked tirelessly, putting in long
hours of rehearsal. Though the process was challenging, our perseverance
and teamwork saw us through. We were absolutely thrilled to clinch the
Distinction Award at the SYF Drama competition in April – a testament to
the passion, hard work, and dedication of both our students and teachers.</p>
<p>Our journey does not stop here. As we gear up for Kaleidoscope II this
November, held in conjunction with our school’s 80<sup>th</sup> anniversary
celebration, the Drama Club is determined to shine once again. With commitment
and creativity, we are ready to give our very best and make our school
proud.</p>
<p>And with that, we say, “Drama, that's a wrap!”</p>
