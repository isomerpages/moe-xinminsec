<h4><strong>Welcome to English Drama Club! üé≠‚ú®</strong></h4>
<p>The English Drama Club kicked off the year with intense preparations for
Xinmin Arts Week in April 2024. Our members were fully immersed in rehearsals
for two original plays written by our own talented students: Fragile Reflections
by Layla and Laura, and The Moon Represents Our Hearts by Alyssa and Isaac.
The journey was challenging, with moments of exhaustion and pressure, but
we pushed through together. The plays turned out to be remarkable, delivering
powerful narratives and meaningful lessons. Both productions hold a special
place in our hearts, as they were pivotal in the growth and development
of our members. We were thrilled to perform The Moon Represents Our Hearts
again at the N1 Cluster Spin A Tale event in May, though it was bittersweet
as it marked the official farewell to our beloved Sec 4 members. We wish
them a rewarding journey ahead and hope they continue to pursue their passion
for drama at a higher level!</p>
<p>Our journey to the Singapore Youth Festival 2025 began in November 2024,
when we embarked on preparations for The Story of Boy and Girl. For many
of our members, it was a brand-new experience. The play underwent countless
rounds of refinement, brought to life by a passionate cast and crew as
we explored powerful themes of identity, self-expression, and perseverance.
From our first rehearsal to the final curtain call, the process was both
demanding and transformative. We faced long hours, tough feedback, and
moments of self-doubt‚Äîbut with each challenge, we grew stronger. Performing
at SYF was an unforgettable culmination of months of dedication, creativity,
and heart. We are immensely proud of what we accomplished together, and
this production will forever be a treasured chapter in our club‚Äôs story.</p>
<p>While we bid farewell to our graduating members, a new chapter is just
beginning for the rest of the Drama Club. Having recently taken the stage
at the biennial Singapore Youth Festival 2025, we now wait in anticipation
for the results. Our members poured their hearts into every moment of the
performance, showcasing their talent, teamwork, and dedication to making
Xinmin proud. Though the outcome is yet to be known, the experience itself
has already been a rewarding one. With renewed passion and creativity,
we look ahead to what‚Äôs next. And with that, we say, ‚ÄúDrama, that's a wrap!‚Äù</p>
