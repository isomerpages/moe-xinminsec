In shooting, mental fortitude and physical strength are equally important, as the sport demands consistency and precision. Through regular training, our shooters develop concentration and tenacity to overcome their greatest opponent: themselves. To test their abilities, our shooters get to compete in invitational shooting competitions, as well as the coveted annual National School Games Shooting Championship. Under the expert coaching of our professional coaches, to date, we have groomed at least 18 Xinmin students who were offered the opportunity to train in the National Youth Team.</p><p>Our shooters have worked hard to achieve good results at the 2023 NSG Shooting Championship.</p><p><strong>Accomplishments</strong><br>B Div:<br>APW (National 5th)<br>APM (National Champion)<br>ARW (National 6th)<br>ARM (National Champion) <br></p><p>C Div:<br>APW (National 6th)<br>APM (National 6th )<br>ARW (National 4th) <br>ARM (National 4th)<br></p><p>Individual Medal<br>C Div: ARM (National 3rd, Zaxis Tay, 206))<br>C Div: ARW (National 3rd, Claire Yeo, 206)<br>B Div: APM (National Champion, Andrew Khoo Zhi Cheng, 406)<br>(National 5th, Davion Teo, 402)<br></p><p><strong>Teachers-in-charge</strong><br>Ms Norfarhana Abdullah (IC)<br>Ms Norhuda Bte Maksum<br>Ms Chua Ai Zhen Kris<br>Mr Annie Ng<br>Ms Nor'ain Binte Ismail<br><br></p><p><strong>Student Leaders</strong><br>Captain : Wong Jun Xiang, (401, 2024)</p><p>Vice Captain (PT): Brayden Ang, (402, 2024)</p><p>Vice Captain (Welfare): Xavier Tay, (405, 2024)</p><p>Vice Captain (Admin): Foo Xin Yun, (404, 2024)</p><p>Sec 4 YC: Yvaine Neo, (402, 2024)</p><p>Sec 3 YC: Giselle Tan, (402, 2024)</p><p>Sec 2 YC: Yao Zhang, (401, 2024)</p><p>Sec 1 YC: Joshua Chia, (403, 2024)<br></p><p><strong>CCA Schedule</strong><br>Monday - 3.30-630pm<br>Tuesday - 3.30-630pm<br>Wednesday - 3.30-630pm<br>Thursday - 3.30-630pm<br>Friday - 1.30-4.30pm<br></p><p><strong>Instagram</strong><br></p>
