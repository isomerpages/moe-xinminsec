<p><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Shooting Team!</strong>
</p>
<p>The Xinmin Shooting Team was established in 2004 to ignite students’ passion
for 10m air rifle and air pistol shooting. In this sport, both mental fortitude
and physical strength are essential, as success hinges on consistency and
precision. Through regular training, our shooters cultivate concentration
and resilience, learning to overcome their greatest opponent: themselves.
To test their skills, our team competes in invitational shooting competitions
as well as the prestigious annual National School Games Shooting Championship.
Under the guidance of our professional coaches, we have nurtured at least
18 Xinmin students who have been invited to train with the National Youth
Team.</p>
<p>Our shooters have put in tremendous effort to achieve impressive results
at the 2024 NSG Shooting Championship.</p>
