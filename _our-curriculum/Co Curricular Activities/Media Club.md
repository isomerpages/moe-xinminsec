<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Media Club!</strong></h4>
<p>The Xinmin Media Club consists of three main departments: Audio Visual
Aid (AVA), Photography, and Videography, along with an Infocomm elective.
Our mission is to inspire creativity and technical excellence in media
production while providing vital support for school events and nurturing
future media professionals.</p>
<p>We play a crucial role in delivering media support for significant school
events as well as various festive celebrations throughout the year. We
believe that applying learned skills in real-world situations is essential
for helping each member reach their full potential. In our CCA, senior
members mentor and guide junior members, ensuring an effective transfer
of knowledge within the club. Alongside developing technical skills, we
uphold our core values of respect, responsibility, and resilience, which
guide our members as they undertake projects that benefit both the school
and the broader community.</p>
<p>Our members also engage in workshops organised by the Infocomm Media Development
Authority (IMDA), covering topics such as Apple New Media and UGOT robotics.
Led by industry professionals, these sessions significantly enhance our
members’ technical skills while providing valuable insights into the media
sector.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Xinmin Media Club is committed to offering enriching
experiences that develop essential 21st Century Competencies, such as critical
and adaptive thinking, collaboration, and communication skills. These skills
are vital for thriving in a rapidly digitalizing world, and we aim to nurture
a generation of media-savvy, civic-minded students who are not only skilled
but also equipped with the values and competencies needed to make meaningful
contributions to society.</p>

we empower our student leaders to become civic-minded individuals capable
of leading with empathy and making meaningful contributions within and
beyond the school community.</p>
