<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Media Club!</strong></h4>
<p>The Xinmin Media Club consists of three main departments: Audio Visual
Aid (AVA), Photography, and Videography, along with an Infocomm elective.
Our mission is to inspire creativity and technical excellence in media
production while providing vital support for school events and nurturing
future media professionals.</p>
<p>We play a crucial role in delivering media support for significant school
events, including the 2024 Cross Country and Xinmin Arts Week, as well
as various festive celebrations throughout the year. We believe that applying
learned skills in real-world situations is essential for helping each member
reach their full potential. In our CCA, senior members mentor and guide
junior members, ensuring an effective transfer of knowledge within the
club. Alongside developing technical skills, we uphold our core values
of respect, responsibility, and resilience, which guide our members as
they undertake projects that benefit both the school and the broader community.</p>
<p>Our members also engage in workshops organized by the Infocomm Media Development
Authority (IMDA), covering topics such as the Internet of Things and Immersive
Media with Apple. Led by industry professionals, these sessions significantly
enhance our members’ technical skills while providing valuable insights
into the media sector.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Xinmin Media Club is committed to offering enriching
experiences that develop essential 21st Century Competencies, such as critical
and adaptive thinking, collaboration, and communication skills. These skills
are vital for thriving in a rapidly digitalizing world, and we aim to nurture
a generation of media-savvy, civic-minded students who are not only skilled
but also equipped with the values and competencies needed to make meaningful
contributions to society.</p>
