The Xinmin Chinese Dance Troupe was established in 1995. In 1999, the girls participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Central Judging and were awarded a Silver medal. In 2001, they participated in the SYF again and clinched the Gold award.

The troupe was awarded the Gold Award again in the SYF in 2003 and 2005. The year 2007 was significant as it was the first time the troupe was awarded the Gold with Honours award, which it sustained for the next two consecutive SYFs (2009 and 2011). In the SYF Arts Presentation 2013, 2015 and 2017, they obtained the Distinction Award.

Despite the 2021 SYF Arts Presentation being filled with challenges posed by COVID-19, there were new opportunities that arose out of it. We had the opportunity to present two performances, 牧歌and 繁花 on stage and gave younger dancers a chance to perform and learn on a larger platform. The dancers worked as a team to overcome the challenges and succeeded in attaining a Certificate of Distinction and Certificate of Accomplishment respectively. In 2023, the dance troupe performed a dance item titled 春语 and attained a Certificate of Distinction.

The dancers were honoured to be invited to perform at a National Day Dinner in 2016 where Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was the Guest of Honour. In addition, the dancers also performed at the Esplanade Outdoor Theatre in 2016 and 2017, as part of the SYF Youth Celebrations. In 2022, the dancers were invited to perform at the Ang Mo Kio−Hougang National Day dinner and a group of dancers participated in the D:2 Dance Competition. In 2023, the Xinmin Chinese Dance team was invited to perform at the Chinese Dance Fiesta organised by the Singapore Chinese Dance Theatre and their performance was well-received by the audience.
