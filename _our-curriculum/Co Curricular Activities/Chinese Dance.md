<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Chinese Dance (XMCD)!</strong></h4>
<p>Since our founding in 1995, we have dedicated ourselves to cultivating
a vibrant and passionate community of dancers under the guidance of our
esteemed instructor, Ms Zou Yi. As we continue our journey toward dance
excellence, we warmly invite you to join us and share in our passion. Welcome
aboard!</p>
<p>At Xinmin Chinese Dance, we believe that learning dance transcends mastering
techniques and choreography. Our members express themselves through movement
while developing discipline, teamwork, and a deep appreciation for the
beauty of the performing arts. The dance team practices regularly to prepare
for various competitions, including the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)
Arts Presentation, as well as performances for significant events like
Chinese Dance Fiesta and the ASEAN Federation of Engineering Organisations
Mid-Term Welcome Reception. Each performance allows our dancers to showcase
not only their technical skills but also the passion and emotion that stem
from hours of dedicated practice.</p>

Bonding Day. These individuals are given opportunities to enhance their
abilities by orchestrating events and assuming specific roles during each
dance practice session.</p>

<h4><strong>Excellence:</strong></h4>
<p>In 2023, the Xinmin Chinese Dance team participated in the Chinese Dance
Fiesta, organised by the Singapore Chinese Dance Theatre, where their performance
was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience. In 2024, the dance
troupe had the honour of performing at the ASEAN Federation of Engineering
Organisations' Mid-Term Welcome Reception and at The Institution of Engineers'
58th Annual Dinner. The following year, in 2025, the troupe was selected
to perform once again at the Chinese Dance Fiesta held at the DBS Foundation.
These performances are in addition to the members’ participation in the
annual Chinese New Year and Speech Day performances held in school.</p>
<p>The troupe's journey has been defined by continuous growth and unwavering
dedication. With each performance, they faced new challenges, pushing the
limits of their abilities and demonstrating remarkable resilience and determination.
Their commitment to excellence was evident as they consistently built upon
their achievements, year after year. In 2023, the troupe performed a piece
titled “春语” and earned a Certificate of Distinction at the SYF. Building
on this success, they further expanded their horizons in 2025. After many
months of discipline and preparation, the troupe performed a piece titled
“飘·絮” at the SYF and received another Certificate of Distinction.</p>

audience, promoting cultural appreciation and understanding within the
community.
