<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Chinese Dance (XMCD)!</strong></h4>
<p>Since our founding in 1995, we have dedicated ourselves to cultivating
a vibrant and passionate community of dancers under the guidance of our
esteemed instructor, Ms Zou Yi. As we continue our journey toward dance
excellence, we warmly invite you to join us and share in our passion. Welcome
aboard!</p>
<p>At Xinmin Chinese Dance, we believe that learning dance transcends mastering
techniques and choreography. Our members express themselves through movement
while developing discipline, teamwork, and a deep appreciation for the
beauty of the performing arts. The dance team practices regularly to prepare
for various competitions, including the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)
Arts Presentation, as well as performances for significant events like
Chinese Dance Fiesta and the ASEAN Federation of Engineering Organisations
Mid-Term Welcome Reception. Each performance allows our dancers to showcase
not only their technical skills but also the passion and emotion that stem
from hours of dedicated practice.</p>

leaders, who refine their leadership skills by spearheading key events
such as the Sec 1 Welcome Tea, Sec 4 and 5 Farewell, and the Chinese Dance
Bonding Day. These individuals are given opportunities to enhance their
abilities by orchestrating events and assuming specific roles during each
dance practice session.</p>

<p>In 2022, our dancers were invited to perform at the Ang Mo Kio−Hougang
National Day Dinner. The following year, the Xinmin Chinese Dance team
participated in the Chinese Dance Fiesta organized by the Singapore Chinese
Dance Theatre, where their performance received enthusiastic applause from
the audience. In 2024, the dance troupe was honoured to perform at the
ASEAN Federation of Engineering Organisations Mid-Term Welcome Reception,
attended by guests from various countries.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19 during the 2021 SYF Arts Presentation,
new opportunities emerged. We showcased two performances, 牧歌 and 繁花, providing
younger dancers with the chance to perform and learn on a larger platform.
Working collaboratively, our dancers overcame these obstacles, ultimately
earning a Certificate of Distinction and a Certificate of Accomplishment
for their respective performances. In 2023, the troupe performed a piece
titled 春语 and achieved a Certificate of Distinction.</p>

<h4><strong>Community Engagement:</strong></h4>
<p>Beyond our school, XMCD is committed to connecting with the broader community.
Participation in events like the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) expands
our members' horizons, enabling them to connect with fellow dancers and
industry professionals, fostering relationships that may lead to future
collaborations and learning opportunities.</p>
<p>Public performances, such as the Ang Mo Kio-Hougang National Day Dinner
and the Chinese Dance Fiesta, allow us to showcase the art form to a wider
audience, promoting cultural appreciation and understanding within the
community.
<br>Join us on an exciting journey with Xinmin Chinese Dance, where we practice
with the humility of never having won and perform with the confidence of
never having lost!</p>
