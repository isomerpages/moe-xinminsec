<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Guzheng Ensemble</strong>,</h4>
<p>where the rich tradition of the instrument harmonizes with the vibrant
energy of our students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At Xinmin Guzheng Ensemble, we believe that learning the Guzheng
transcends the mere mastery of notes and melodies. Our members discover
the art of musical expression while developing discipline, teamwork, and
a deep appreciation for the performing arts. Regular practice sessions
prepare the ensemble for a range of performances, including school events
and regional competitions. In each performance, students demonstrate not
only technical precision but also the soul and emotion that stem from hours
of dedicated practice. Here are some of the ensemble’s key activities:</p>

role in shaping the CCA experience. Comprising a dynamic mix of Sec 2 and
3 students, the EXCO is given numerous opportunities to cultivate their
leadership skills. Together, they foster a positive culture and set the
direction for the ensemble. The President (Music) work closely with members,
providing coaching based on instructor feedback, while the Vice Presidents
(Well-being and Discipline) and Level Leaders ensure the welfare and cohesion
of all members. The Logistics Team manages the smooth execution of practices,
and the Publicity Team creatively promotes the ensemble’s activities to
engage the school and community.</p>
