<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Guzheng Ensemble</strong>,</h4>
<p>where the rich tradition of the instrument harmonizes with the vibrant
energy of our students.</p>
<p>At Xinmin Guzheng Ensemble, we believe that learning the Guzheng transcends
the mere mastery of notes and melodies. Our members discover the art of
musical expression while developing discipline, teamwork, and a deep appreciation
for the performing arts. Regular practice sessions prepare the ensemble
for a range of performances, including school events and regional competitions.
In each performance, students demonstrate not only technical precision
but also the soul and emotion that stem from hours of dedicated practice.
Here are some of the ensemble’s key activities:</p>

direction for the ensemble. The Vice President(s) (Music) work closely
with members, providing coaching based on instructor feedback, while the
