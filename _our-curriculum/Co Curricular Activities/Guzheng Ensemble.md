<p>Welcome to Xinmin Guzheng Ensemble, where the rich tradition of the instrument
harmonizes with the vibrant energy of our students.</p>
<p>At Xinmin Guzheng Ensemble, we believe that learning the Guzheng transcends
the mere mastery of notes and melodies. Our members discover the art of
musical expression while developing discipline, teamwork, and a deep appreciation
for the performing arts. Regular practice sessions prepare the ensemble
for a range of performances, including school events and regional competitions.
In each performance, students demonstrate not only technical precision
but also the soul and emotion that stem from hours of dedicated practice.
Here are some of the ensemble’s key activities:</p>
<p><strong>Activities</strong>
<br>a) Sec 1 CCA Orientation</p>
<p>b) Chinese New Year Celebrations</p>
<p>c) Speech Day</p>
<p>d) Xinmin Arts Week</p>
<p>e) Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation</p>
<p>f) Open House</p>
<p>g) Ad-hoc external performance opportunities</p>
<p><strong>CCA Schedule</strong>
<br>Wednesdays: 3pm to 6.30pm
<br>Fridays: 2pm to 5:30pm</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Development:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Executive Committee (EXCO) of the Guzheng Ensemble plays a pivotal
role in shaping the CCA experience. Comprising a dynamic mix of Sec 2 and
3 students, the EXCO is given numerous opportunities to cultivate their
leadership skills. Together, they foster a positive culture and set the
direction for the ensemble. The Vice President(s) (Music) work closely
with members, providing coaching based on instructor feedback, while the
Vice President (Well-being) and Level Leaders ensure the welfare and cohesion
of all members. The Logistics Team manages the smooth execution of practices,
and the Publicity Team creatively promotes the ensemble’s activities to
engage the school and community.</p>
