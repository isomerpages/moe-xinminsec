<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Chorale!</strong></h4>
<p>Here, youths passionate about singing have the chance to hone their vocal
abilities under the expert musical direction of our dedicated conductor,
Mr. Yong Chee Foon.</p>
<p>Beyond learning songs in various languages and preparing for performances,
members are encouraged to plan and lead activities that strengthen the
bonds within the choir. Whenever possible, we also participate in exchange
programmes with other school choirs and youth choirs from around the world.
We firmly believe that by providing the right environment, guidance, and
opportunities, our members not only enhance their singing and performance
skills but also grow into gracious individuals, embracing the school’s
core values of respect, responsibility, and resilience.</p>

<h4><strong>Excellence:</strong></h4>
<p>Despite our relatively short history, Xinmin Chorale has consistently
earned accolades at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), receiving Gold
Awards consecutively since 2005 and a Gold (With Honours) Award in 2011.
In 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2023, we were honoured with the prestigious
Certificate of Distinction at the SYF Arts Presentation. To sustain our
choir’s excellence, our singers are regularly coached by internationally
renowned choral conductors, composers, and clinicians, providing them with
invaluable exposure to further develop their talents.</p>
<p>In 2017, 2019, and 2023, Xinmin Chorale successfully staged public concerts
at the Esplanade Concert Hall as part of the Limelight series, which showcases
some of Singapore’s finest school choirs and symphonic bands at Esplanade
– Theatres on the Bay.</p>
<p>Creative Collaboration: We actively engage in exchange programmes and
combined-school performances, such as the SuperNova Concert, hosted by
Anglo-Chinese School in 2019, by Xinmin in 2022, and by Fairfield Methodist
School in 2023.</p>
