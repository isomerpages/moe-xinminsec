<h4><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Chorale!</strong></h4>
<p>At Xinmin Chorale, students with a passion for singing come together to
express themselves through music. Under the expert musical direction of
our dedicated conductor, Mr. Yong Chee Foon, members refine their vocal
abilities and learn to perform confidently across a wide range of genres
and languages.</p>
<p>Beyond learning songs in various languages and preparing for performances,
members are encouraged to plan and lead activities that strengthen the
bonds within the choir. We also look forward to exchange programmes with
other local school choirs and beyond the shores of Singapore — learning,
sharing, and growing through every experience.</p>
<p>At Xinmin Chorale, we firmly believe that with the right guidance, a supportive
environment, and opportunities, every member can develop not just as a
performer, but as a gracious and resilient individual who embodies our
school’s core values of <strong>Respect, Responsibility, and Resilience</strong>.</p>

<h4><strong>Excellence:</strong></h4>
<p>Despite our relatively short history, Xinmin Chorale has consistently
earned accolades at the <strong>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)</strong>,
receiving Gold Awards consecutively since 2005 and a Gold (With Honours)
Award in 2011. In 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2023, and 2025, we were honoured
with the prestigious Certificate of Distinction at the SYF Arts Presentation.
To sustain our choir’s excellence, our singers are regularly coached by
internationally renowned choral conductors, composers, and clinicians,
providing them with invaluable exposure to further develop their talents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2017, 2019, and 2023, Xinmin Chorale successfully staged public
concerts at the Esplanade Concert Hall as part of the <strong>Limelight</strong> series,
which showcases some of Singapore’s finest school choirs and symphonic
bands at Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Beyond performances, we actively engage in exchange programmes and
combined-school performances, such as the SuperNova Concert, hosted by
Anglo-Chinese School in 2019, by Xinmin in 2022, and by Fairfield Methodist
School in 2023 and 2025.&nbsp;</p>
