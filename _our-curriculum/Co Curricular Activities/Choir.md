<p><strong>Welcome to Xinmin Chorale!</strong>
</p>
<p>Here, youths passionate about singing have the chance to hone their vocal
abilities under the expert musical direction of our dedicated conductor,
Mr. Yong Chee Foon.</p>
<p>Beyond learning songs in various languages and preparing for performances,
members are encouraged to plan and lead activities that strengthen the
bonds within the choir. Whenever possible, we also participate in exchange
programmes with other school choirs and youth choirs from around the world.
We firmly believe that by providing the right environment, guidance, and
opportunities, our members not only enhance their singing and performance
skills but also grow into gracious individuals, embracing the school’s
core values of respect, responsibility, and resilience.</p>

invaluable exposure to further develop their talents.</p>
