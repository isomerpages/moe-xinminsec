<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users.
It involves an understanding of online behaviours and awareness of how
to protect oneself in the cyberspace.</p>
<p>The focus of CW is on guiding our students to be responsible digital learners.
The curriculum aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to
harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence
in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.</p>
<p>In addition to the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons,
there will also be workshops and assembly talks conducted to reinforce
the importance of CW and its messages. Our school strongly believes in
the importance of positive peer influence where platforms are available
for students to learn, share and advocate for positive online behaviours.</p>

<h2>Mental Health</h2>
<p>Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope
with the stresses of life, realise their abilities, learn well, work well
and contribute to their community. To strengthen studentsâ€™ mental well-being,
they need to be equipped with knowledge and skills to manage their thoughts
and feelings, build their resilience, and resolve their challenges. Through
CCE lessons, assembly talks and sharing by students, students will learn
strategies to overcome their social emotional problems and seek help when
they need to. Our Class Committee members will also go through peer support
trainings, which will allow them to better support their peers proactively.</p>
