<h2>Belief</h2><p>Xinmin Secondary School believes in developing Curious Learners and Compassionate Contributors. The design of the school’s CCE Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame and is anchored on the school’s values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience.</p><h2>Curriculum</h2><p><strong>CCE Lessons</strong><br>CCE Lessons include areas such as National Education (NE), Sexuality Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness (CW), and Family Education (FE), are integrated within a school-wide approach.</p><p><strong>Contemporary Issues</strong><br>Discussion of contemporary issues in the CCE lessons aims to develop active citizenry and critical thinking among students, by helping them understand the multiple perspectives on current issues. Contemporary issues are discussed fortnightly.</p><p><strong>Student Development Experiences</strong><br>Student Development Experiences (SDEs) are programmes and activities that contribute towards the holistic development of our students in the physical, aesthetic, intellectual, moral, and social domains.</p><p>Some of the SDEs in Xinmin Secondary School include experiences in Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Experiences, National Education (NE) Commemorative Days and our signature VIA programme, XinminCares.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_1.jpg" src="/images/Cce/Cce/cce_1a.jpeg"></div><p>A Sec 3 student receiving his NRIC as part of a citizenship lesson</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_2.jpg" src="/images/Cce/Cce/cce_1b.jpeg"></div><p>Students embarking on a VIA project about littering in our environment as part of XinminCares</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_1.jpg" src="/images/Cce/Cce/cce_1c.jpeg"></div><p>Students writing words of encouragement for migrant workers during a lesson about their struggles during Circuit Breaker</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="margin: auto;

This helps them understand the perspectives of people with different backgrounds or cultures, and to become more sensitive to the social environment and the needs of others. Using this approach, student learn to apply moral reasoning and sound values-based judgements in the choices they make, and understanding the impact and consequences of their actions on others.</p><p><strong>Student-Centric Pedagogy</strong><br>The use of instructional and facilitation strategies such as circle structure, four corners, freeze frame, hot seat, round table, role-play, debate etc, promotes students’ voice and empowers students to express their views during CCE lessons. Through the interaction, it also strengthens both teacher-student relationships and student-student relationships.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_1.jpg" src="/images/Cce/Cce/cce_2a.jpeg"></div><p>‘Four Corners’ being used as a facilitation strategy to discover multiple perspectives in the lesson on overcoming stereotypes lesson</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_2.jpg" src="/images/Cce/Cce/cce_2b.png"></div><p>Students engaging in role-play and making use of online tool to rationalise and share their perspectives</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_1.jpg" src="/images/Cce/Cce/cce_2c.png"></div><p>Eliciting opinions about mental health using Menti as a lead-up to a discussion about help seeking and resilience</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="margin: auto;
