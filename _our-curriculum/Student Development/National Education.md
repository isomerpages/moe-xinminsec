<p>National Education is a key component of Singapore's education system and is integrated into the curriculum at all levels, from primary school to tertiary education. National Education seeks to foster a strong sense of belonging to Singapore among its citizens. This involves promoting a shared national identity, history, and culture.</p><p>Our students’ NE experience will include our NE Commemorative Days, NE in subjects (e.g. Character and Citizenship Education, History), Co-Curricular activities such as CCA/VIA and our daily routines such as flag raising ceremony. Our NE experience will anchor on the following 3 citizenship dispositions:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>A sense of belonging</strong>: To develop a deeper understanding of who we are, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation.</p></li><li><p><strong>A sense of reality</strong>: To be aware of the contemporary realities — including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.</p></li><li><p><strong>A sense of hope</strong>: Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead. In Xinmin, our NE commemorative events are led and planned by our students and strongly supported by different stakeholders of the school. For example, our school staff, alumni and parent volunteers also formed a contingent and participated in our 2023 National Day Parade! We hope that all students have a sense of shared mission to continue the legacy of our forefathers and strive for the peace and prosperity of our nation.</p></li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_1.jpg" src="/images/Cce/National_education/ndp alumni and staff contingent.jpeg"></div><p>NDP Alumni and Staff Contingent</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_2.jpg" src="/images/Cce/National_education/ndp alumni sharing on national service.jpeg"></div><p>NDP Alumni Sharing on National Service</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_1.jpg" src="/images/Cce/National_education/ndp staff contingent.jpeg"></div><p>NDP Staff Contingent</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_2.jpg" src="/images/Cce/National_education/ndp sticker designed by students.jpeg"></div><p>NDP sticker designed by students</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_1.jpg" src="/images/Cce/National_education/racial harmony day staff photo.jpeg"></div><p>Racial Harmony Day Staff Photo</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_2.jpg" src="/images/Cce/National_education/racial harmony day student photo booth.jpeg"></div><p>Racial Harmony Day Student Photo Booth</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_2.jpg" src="/images/Cce/National_education/total defence day first aid lesson.jpeg"></div><p>Total Defence Day First Aid Lesson</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
