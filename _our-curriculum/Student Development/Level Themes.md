<h2>Level Themes</h2><p>We adopt a thematic approach that is age-appropriate and developmentally progressive so that our students can navigate their years in Xinmin successfully:</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Cce/Total%20Curriculum/level%20themes_image.png"></div><p>Each level theme is also aligned to our schoolâ€™s vision, mission and values and is further defined by desired outcomes that we hope our students achieve so that they can embrace the future with confidence and optimism. There are ample platforms and opportunities for our students to develop important skill-sets and to empower them to lead and contribute to school and community.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Cce/Total%20Curriculum/table_3.png"></div><p></p>
