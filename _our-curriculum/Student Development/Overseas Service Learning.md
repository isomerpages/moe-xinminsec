<br>Students in Xinmin Secondary School have many opportunities to give back
to the community, but we believe in extending that learning about various
communities to even beyond Singapore. To that end, Overseas Service Learning
(OSL) is a specialised programme where Secondary 3 students are given the
opportunity to embark on a 10-day trip to a rural village in South-east
Asia to participate in service learning. Over the course of the trip, students
will help to improve the lives of villagers through activities such as
building communal toilets, raising the flooring of houses prone to flooding,
refurbishing village schools, constructing water tanks, and many more.</p>
<p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had two teams of students travel to
Thailand and Vietnam respectively. Team Thailand helped to fix a village
well and conducted activities for the village children while Team Vietnam
helped to raise the floor of a house that had been severely flooded during
the monsoon season as well as give the walls of a local school and university
a new coat of paint and murals. Over the course of the trips, the students
worked tirelessly during the day to complete the projects while also interacting
with local students to help improve their conversational English. There
were also nightly reflection sessions to guide the students in learning
more about both the communities they were serving, as well as themselves
as compassionate contributors.</p>
<p>For many of the students who have embarked on OSL trips, this programme
is the highlight of their Xinmin school experience because of how much
they are able to learn about themselves and the world at large. In many
of their individual reflections, these students realise just how much they
end up taking for granted in their day-to-day life. Following the trip,
many have endeavoured to improve their outlook and strengthened their desire
to continue giving back to the community, both local and overseas.</p>
<p>The main objective of Xinmin Change Initiators (XCI) is to give students
a platform to pursue their passion for service learning and give back to
the community. This is especially so for the Sec 3 and 4 students who have
completed their XinminCares programme, or for Sec 1 and 2 students who
desire to go beyond XinminCares.</p>

<p>For XCI, students will form their own groups and approach a local organisation
of their choice. Working together with the organisation, they will develop
a plan/project that meets the latterâ€™s needs, with little involvement of
the teacher. An example of this was when in 2022, Xinmin students approached
AWWA School @ Napiri to engage the students in crafts activities and games.</p>

<p>The school also provides a list of pre-existing projects/ organisations
that students will be able to select from, but still come up with their
own way of executing their project. This was the case with students who
took part in the Go Green campaign and came up with a survey to find out
how to improve on reducing plastic use for food takeaway in school.</p>

<p>In XCI, students are also able to contribute in projects initiated by
our community partners. For this projects, all a student has to do is to
look out for emails from various teachers-in-charge and sign up to be a
volunteer for the project. These kinds of projects are often the first
step for students to find out more about the communities that they feel
passionate for. This year, we had students take part in Run for Inclusion,
a carnival where Xinmin students partnered special needs students from
AWWA School @ Napiri for a short walk/run</p>
