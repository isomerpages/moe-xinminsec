### Academic Learning @ Xinmin
At Xinmin Secondary, curriculum design is undergirded by the XM Teaching &amp; Learning Framework. The academic curriculum is holistic and comprehensive, and implemented through the 3 ‘C’ approach.

* Create – Through critical and inventive thinking, applied to real world contexts.<br>
* Connect – To knowledge, people and world.<br>
* Cultivate – A sound identity anchored in values and a lifelong passion for learning.

The Lower Secondary Programme enables Xinmin students to establish a strong foundation for a confident and successful transition to upper secondary. Consequently, the Upper Secondary Programme provides an array of subject combinations that enable Xinmin students to develop strong pre-requisites for post-secondary education and future work demands.
