**Core Subjects**<br>
With the implementation of Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB), students can learn the core subjects at the level that best caters to their overall strengths, interests and learning needs. Certain core subjects will be offered at a more demanding level (MDL) at three specific junctures. 


**Common Curriculum Subjects**<br>
Under Full SBB, Express, N(A), and N(T) streams will be phased out . Xinmin students will be placed in mixed form classes at lower secondary where they can interact with peers of different strengths and interests via the common curriculum. Differentiated instruction (D.I.), customisation and project-based learning are key levers to achieve these developmental objectives among diverse learners:

Experiential Modules
Beyond the core subjects and the common curriculum, Xinmin students are further exposed to two essential experiential modules to hone their 21st century skills and competencies further.

•**Coding@Xinmin**<br>
‘If you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn.’ ~ Stephen Hawkings

Through Coding@Xinmin, students:<br>
1.	Discover and develop computational thinking.<br>
2.	Acquire fundamental programming skills and languages.<br>
3.	Attempt challenges requiring conceptualisation and problem-solving.<br>
4.	Learn through gamification.

•	**RefleXions@Xinmin**<br>
Drama education teaches students how to communicate, how to listen, and how to be empathetic.’ ~ Andrew Lloyd Webber

Through RefleXions@Xinmin, students:<br>
1.	Gain exposure and learn to apply elements of drama skills.<br>
2.	Acquire thinking routines that encourage critical thinking and reflection.<br>
3.	Create original scripts and put up drama performances.<br>
4.	Develop pre-requisites to offer Drama at upper secondary.<br>


### Secondary 1 students entering in 2024  

Starting from the 2024 Secondary 1 cohort, Full Subject-Based Banding (SBB) will be implemented in our secondary education system. Secondary 1 students will benefit from the Full SBB experience, which provides greater customisation and flexibility for each student’s learning.

Students will be allocated a set of subjects ranging from G1 to G3 which are comparable to the respective Achievement Levels (AL). This allocation is committed by MOE’s placement branch. The guidelines below apply to English, MTL Mathematics and Science.

To offer Higher Mother Tongue Languages (HMTL) - Chinese, Malay, Tamil and Non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL), students should preferably obtain either:<br>
1.	An overall PSLE Score of 8 or better.<br>
2.	An overall PSLE Score of 9 to 14 and get AL1 or AL2 in MTL, or Distinction or Merit in HMTL.


Note: Students taking Tamil or NTIL will be taking lessons at designated schools or language centres, and not in Xinmin Secondary School.

Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may offer these subjects at more demanding level (MDL) based on their performance in school, as well as by demonstrating positive attitude towards learning.

### Secondary 2 students (In Academic Year 2025)
* The lower secondary programme spans over 2 years so students will continue the same set of subjects taken in Secondary 1. 

* Students who were offered English, MTL, Mathematics, Science (in Secondary 1) at MDL will continue to take them at Secondary 2. Those who performed well for the Humanities in Secondary 1 will have the opportunity to offer at least History, Geography or Literature at MDL in Secondary 2. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary 1.

* Students are advised to challenge themselves and master the subjects up to the end of Secondary 2.
