## Academic Learning @ Xinmin

At Xinmin Secondary, curriculum design is undergirded by the XM Teaching & Learning Framework. The academic curriculum is holistic and comprehensive, and implemented through the 3 ‘C’ approach.

* Create – Through critical and inventive thinking, applied to real world contexts.
* Connect – To knowledge, people and world.
* Cultivate – A sound identity anchored in values and a lifelong passion for learning.

The Lower Secondary Programme enables Xinmin students to establish a strong foundation for a confident and successful transition to upper secondary. Consequently, the Upper Secondary Programme provides an array of subject combinations that enable Xinmin students to develop strong pre-requisites for post-secondary education and future work demands.
