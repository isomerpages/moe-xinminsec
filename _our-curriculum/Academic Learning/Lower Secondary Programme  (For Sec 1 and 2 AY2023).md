**Core Subjects**<br>
With the implementation of Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB), students can learn the core subjects at the level that best caters to their overall strengths, interests and learning needs. Certain core subjects will be offered at a more demanding level (MDL) at three specific junctures. 


**Common Curriculum Subjects**<br>
Under Full SBB, Express, N(A), and N(T) streams will be phased out from 2024 onwards. Currently, Xinmin students will be  placed in mixed form classes at lower secondary where they can interact with peers of different strengths and interests via the common curriculum. Differentiated instruction (D.I.), customisation and project-based learning are key levers to achieve these developmental objectives among diverse learners:

**Experiential Modules**<br>
Beyond the core subjects and the common curriculum, Xinmin students are further exposed to two essential experiential modules to hone their 21st century skills and competencies further.

•	**Coding@Xinmin**<br>
‘If you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn.’ ~ Stephen Hawkings

Through Coding@Xinmin, students:<br>
1.	Discover and develop computational thinking.<br>
2.	Acquire fundamental programming skills and languages.<br>
3.	Attempt challenges requiring conceptualisation and problem-solving.<br>
4.	Learn through gamification.<br>

•	**RefleXions@Xinmin**<br>
Drama education teaches students how to communicate, how to listen, and how to be empathetic.’ ~ Andrew Lloyd Webber

Through RefleXions@Xinmin, students:<br>
1.	Gain exposure and learn to apply elements of drama skills.<br>
2.	Acquire thinking routines that encourage critical thinking and reflection.<br>
3.	Create original scripts and put up drama performances.<br>
4.	Develop pre-requisites to offer Drama at upper secondary.<br>


### Current Secondary 1 students (In Academic Yr 2023)
The allocation of subject/levels is provided by MOE’s placement branch based on students’ PSLE Achievement Levels (ALs).

To offer Higher Mother Tongue Languages (HMTL) - Chinese, Malay, Tamil and Non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL), students should preferably obtain either:<br><br>
1.	Studied HMTL in primary school; Pass in HMTL for PSLE; and PSLE overall lower than AL16.<br><br>
2.	Did not take HMTL in primary school; Scored AL1or 2 in MTL for PSLE; and PSLE overall lower than AL16.<br><br>
Note: Students taking Tamil or NTIL will be taking lessons at designated schools or language centres, and not in Xinmin Secondary School.

Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may offer these subjects at more demanding level (MDL) based on their performance in school, as well as by demonstrating positive attitude towards learning.
