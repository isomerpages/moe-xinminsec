<p><strong>Core Subjects</strong>
<br>With the implementation of Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB), students
can learn the core subjects at the level that best caters to their overall
strengths, interests and learning needs. Certain core subjects will be
offered at a more demanding level (MDL) at three specific junctures.</p>
<p><strong>Common Curriculum Subjects</strong>
<br>Under Full SBB, Express, N(A), and N(T) streams will be phased out . Xinmin
students will be placed in mixed form classes at lower secondary where
they can interact with peers of different strengths and interests via the
common curriculum. Differentiated instruction (D.I.), customisation and
project-based learning are key levers to achieve these developmental objectives
among diverse learners:

<p>Experiential Modules Beyond the core subjects and the common curriculum,
Xinmin students are further exposed to two essential experiential modules
to hone their 21st century skills and competencies further.</p>
<p>•<strong>MAKERS@Xinmin</strong>
<br><strong>"The future belongs to those who can innovate, create, and collaborate." ~Tom Friedman</strong>
</p>

<p>• <strong>RefleXions@Xinmin</strong>
<br>Drama education teaches students how to communicate, how to listen, and
how to be empathetic.’ ~ Andrew Lloyd Webber</p>
<p>Through RefleXions@Xinmin, students:
<br>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Secondary 1 students entering from 2024</h3>
<p>Starting from the 2024 Secondary 1 cohort, Full Subject-Based Banding
(SBB) will be implemented in our secondary education system. Secondary
1 students will benefit from the Full SBB experience, which provides greater
customisation and flexibility for each student’s learning.</p>
<p>Students will be allocated a set of subjects ranging from G1 to G3 which
are comparable to the respective Achievement Levels (AL). This allocation
is committed by MOE’s placement branch. The guidelines below apply to English,
MTL Mathematics and Science.

<p>To offer Higher Mother Tongue Languages (HMTL) - Chinese, Malay, Tamil
and Non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL), students should preferably obtain
either:
<br>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An overall PSLE Score of 8 or better.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An overall PSLE Score of 9 to 14 and get AL1 or AL2 in MTL, or Distinction
or Merit in HMTL.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Students taking Tamil or NTIL will be taking lessons at designated
schools or language centres, and not in Xinmin Secondary School.</p>
<p>Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may offer these subjects at
more demanding level (MDL) after mid-year or end-of-year assessments in
Secondary 1, based on their academic performance in school, as well as
by demonstrating positive attitude towards learning.</p>

well for their Weighted Assessments WA).</p>

<h3>Secondary 2 students</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The lower secondary programme spans over 2 years so students will continue
the same set of subjects taken in Secondary 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who were offered English, MTL, Mathematics, Science (in Secondary
1) at MDL will continue to take them at Secondary 2. Those who performed
well for the Humanities in Secondary 1 will have the opportunity to offer
at least History, Geography or Literature at MDL in Secondary 2. The criteria
for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students'
aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are advised to challenge themselves and master the subjects up
to the end of Secondary 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As per MOE’s intent for Full SBB , to support students’ transition from
primary to secondary school and provide time for them to adjust to the
curriculum, all students will generally progress to Secondary 2. Teachers
will check in with students and parents to discuss the subjects and respective
subject levels that best suit the student. Students can offer certain subjects
at a more demanding level based on his/her interest and learning progress.</p>
