<p><strong>Core Subjects</strong>
<br>With the implementation of Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB), students
can take core subjects at three subject levels, known as G1, G2, G3 (G
stands for General), mapped from the previous N(T), N(A), and Express standards
respectively. Students will have the flexibility to adjust their subject
levels at appropriate junctures, based on their readiness, strengths, interests
and learning needs. Students will subsequently access post-secondary pathways
based on their various subjects and subject level combinations.</p>
<p><strong>Common Curriculum Subjects</strong>
<br>Xinmin students will be placed in mixed form classes at lower secondary
where they can interact with peers of different strengths and interests
via the common curriculum. Differentiated instruction (D.I.), customisation,
and project-based learning are key levers to achieve these developmental
objectives among diverse learners:

<p><strong>Xinmin's Signature Programmes</strong>
<br>Beyond the core subjects and the common curriculum, Xinmin students go
through two essential experiential modules to further hone their 21st Century
Competencies.</p>
<p><strong>MAKERS@Xinmin</strong>
<br>"The future belongs to those who can innovate, create, and collaborate."
~Tom Friedman</p>
<p>Through MAKERS@Xinmin, students:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop curiosity and lifelong passion for analogue and digital making.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster adaptive and inventive thinking.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquire design, prototyping, and iteration skills.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquire 21st Century skills in AI, digital literacy, problem-solving,
and creative thinking through eco sustainability challenges.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RefleXions@Xinmin</strong>
<br>"Drama education teaches students how to communicate, how to listen, and
how to be empathetic." ~ Andrew Lloyd Webber</p>
<p>Through RefleXions@Xinmin, students:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Gain exposure and learn to apply elements of drama skills.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquire thinking routines that encourage critical thinking and reflection.
<br>
</p>
</li>

<br>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Secondary 1 Students</h3>
<p><strong><u>Secondary 1 Start-Of-Year</u></strong>
<br>Students will be allocated a set of subjects based on their Posting Group.
To offer Higher Mother Tongue Languages (HMTL) - Chinese, Malay, Tamil
and Non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL), students should obtain either:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>AL1 or AL2 in PSLE MTL, or Distinction or Merit in PSLE HMTL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An overall PSLE Score of 8 or better.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Students taking Tamil or NTIL will take lessons at designated schools
or language centres, and not in Xinmin Secondary School.</p>
<p>For students in Posting Groups 1 and 2, they may be offered English, Mathematics,
MTL, and Science at a more demanding level (MDL) at three specific junctures
in Secondary 1. At the start of Secondary 1, the guidelines below apply:

<p>Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may offer subjects at MDL at
the following junctures, based on their academic performance in school,
as well as by demonstrating positive attitude towards learning. There is
no cap on the number of subjects students can take at MDL.</p>
<p><strong><u>Secondary 1 Mid-Year</u></strong>
<br>At this point, students can take these subjects at MDL if they perform
well for their Weighted Assessments (WAs).</p>

<h3>Secondary 2 Students</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As per MOE’s intent for Full SBB, to support students’ transition from
primary to secondary school and provide time for them to adjust to the
curriculum, all students will generally progress to Secondary 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lower secondary programme spans over 2 years so students will continue
the same set of subjects taken in Secondary 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who were offered English, MTL, Mathematics, and/or Science at
MDL in Secondary 1 will continue to take them at Secondary 2. Those who
performed well for the Humanities in Secondary 1 will have the opportunity
to offer at least History, Geography, or Literature at MDL in Secondary
2, as explained above.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, students can take these subjects at MDL if they perform
