To help with the subject combination information, a microsite has been set up for parents/guardians and students to understand more about the demands of certain elective subjects at the Upper Secondary level, gather advice on making subject combination decisions and learning more about post-secondary pathways. You will also find the list of subject combinations offered and a timeline for the Subject Combination Allocation Exercise. <br><br>Click <a href="https://sites.google.com/xinminss.edu.sg/xms-subjectcombi/home?authuser=3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to access the microsite.”</p>
