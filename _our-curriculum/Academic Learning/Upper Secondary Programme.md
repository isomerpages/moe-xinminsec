<h3>Upper Secondary Programme</h3>
<p>All our upper secondary subject combinations have been carefully designed
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Equip our students with the necessary and relevant knowledge, skills,
and values so that you can be better prepared for further education, citizenship,
and the world of work; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide our students with the time and space to develop holistically by
pursuing academic achievements and various interests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The tables below reflect the subject combinations which were offered to
the 2025 Secondary Three cohort.</p>
