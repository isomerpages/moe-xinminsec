<h3>2026 Secondary 3 Subject Combination</h3>
<p>The Sec 3 Subject Combination 2025 provides students with the opportunity
to pursue subjects they are passionate about at the upper secondary level.
To help with the subject combination information, a microsite has been
set up for parents/guardians and students to understand more about the
demands of certain elective subjects at the Upper Secondary level, gather
advice on making subject combination decisions and learning more about
post-secondary pathways. You will also find the list of subject combinations
offered and a timeline for the Subject Combination Allocation Exercise.
