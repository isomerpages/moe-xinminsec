Studying Computing/Computer Applications (CPA) goes beyond syntax or block programming in XMS. As an extension to Coding@Xinmin, we offer our students Computing as GCE-O Level Subject/G3 level (Upper Secondary) and Computer Applications as GCE-N Level subject/G1 level (Upper Sec). 

Computing/CPA will foster our students the necessary digital literacies, whilst enhancing their problem-solving abilities through computational thinking. Based on the Computer Education Framework (MOE), students are instill with many concepts that will inculcate them the necessary 21CC through the different lesson designs.

Through various online platforms, students will become adaptable and proficient in many digital tools that can later be applied in different fields. This not only opens up diverse career opportunities but also instills ethical awareness.
