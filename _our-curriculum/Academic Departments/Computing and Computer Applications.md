Studying Computing/Computer Applications (CPA) goes beyond syntax or block programming in XMS. As an extension to Coding@Xinmin, we offer our students Computing as GCE-O Level Subject/G3 level (Upper Secondary) and Computer Applications as GCE-N Level subject/G1 level (Upper Sec). 

Computing/CPA will foster our students the necessary digital literacies, whilst enhancing their problem-solving abilities through computational thinking. Based on the Computer Education Framework (MOE), students are instill with many concepts that will inculcate them the necessary 21CC through the different lesson designs.

Through various online platforms, students will become adaptable and proficient in many digital tools that can later be applied in different fields. This not only opens up diverse career opportunities but also instills ethical awareness. With extensive hands-on experience, our students will enjoy applying their new found skills through many challenges competitions.

**Computing/Computer Applications (CPA)**<br>
Through the Computing/CPA syllabus, students will achieve the following objectives:<br>
* Attain proficiency in utilizing a diverse range of computer application software or use programming solutions and hardware to complete tasks and convey ideas effectively.
* Gain an understanding of the ethical, legal, and security considerations associated with the utilization of computers and information and communication technology (ICT) within society.
* Recognize the broader societal and individual impacts of ICT, acknowledging how it influences people and communities.
* Cultivate fundamental computational thinking and problem-solving abilities, fostering their capacity to tackle various challenges effectively.

For Computing, students will learn through the following modules:
* Data &amp; Information – Excel and Number Systems
* Systems &amp; Communication – Network Design 
* Abstraction and Algorithm – Refinement and Analysis
* Programing using Python  - Program Development

For Computer Applications:, students will learn through the following modules:
* Block-based Coding through Scratch
* Digital Drawing through Inkscape
* Microsoft Office –Powerpoint, Excel and Word


**Pedagogical Approach**<br>
In XMS, active Learning by students is encouraged. There are a variety of hands-on activities, projects, and problem-solving exercises. 
* Coding assignments and debugging tasks are carried out using Google Colab
* Lesson resources through Google Classroom/SLS with hybrid learning modes to promote self-directedness.
* Enhancing problem-solving ability coupled with computational thinking to real world context through newspaper clips. Students are to sieve the gist of the news and reflect how technology can help to solve an inconvenience etc. 
* They are then encouraged through their mini project to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable components and design algorithms to solve them. This applies into their Scratch or Python program. 
* Collaborative Learning: Promote collaboration among students through pair programming, group discussions, and peer code reviews. Collaboration can help students learn from each other and improve their communication skills.
* Assessment and Feedback: Use a variety of assessment methods and test cases that will inform the student on the quality of their coding.
* Variety of online Kahoot quizzes and mini-games
* Coding assignments that have peer evaluations, to gauge student understanding and promote critique..
* Reflection component after every extension activity : Encourage students to reflect on their learning experiences, the challenges they faced, and how they can apply what they've learned in their future endeavors.


**Talent Development**<br>
<u>GCE-O Level Computing</u><br>
Mini Projects (Pygame) are open-ended tasks carried out as part of Secondary 3 curriculum over 8 weeks. The project will be based on authentic tasks founded on real-world problems. There are 2 proposed implementations for the Mini Project, either hardware-based or software based. Students can choose to use either Halocode/Microbit microcontroller to create contraptions as a solution prototype to an identified problem in the community. Past projects include Recycling Shower for Toilet Flushes and Medicine boxes to remind Elderly. Students may also choose to use Unity or Pygame to create a gaming project that has NE themes.

<u>Other Competitions</u>
* TP x VJC Data Science Hackathon
* Ngee Ann - Youth Cyber Exploration Program
* SIT-VJC Project Inspire Program
* DrCT/Bebras- Organised by SIMCC
* ORION X: Decrypted Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of InfoComm Technology (ICT)
* National Software Competition 2023

<u>GCE-N Level Computer Applications</u><br>
Our students have been participating in the Animation and Game Making (AGM) Competition organised by the Computer Education Unit under MOE since 2018.  The objective of this competition is to create a platform for students to exhibit their work, stimulate their enthusiasm for media and game design and enhance their research abilities. Congratulations to our year’s GOLD award winner 2023.
