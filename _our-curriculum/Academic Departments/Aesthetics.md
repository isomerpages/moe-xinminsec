<h2>Aesthetics Department vision</h2>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To develop inquisitiveness towards the Arts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop student voice and choice through the Arts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To advocate appreciation and enjoyment for the Arts across cultures and
perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop the values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience through
the Arts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Belief</h2>
<p>Every Xinmin student should be able to appreciate the Arts, develop through
the Arts and contribute actively through the Arts.</p>
<h2>Approaches</h2>
<p><strong>Create</strong> 
<br>Students get to exercise their creativity when they are allowed to share
their perspectives and ideate towards Arts presentations of different forms.
Students enjoy creating original pieces across the Art forms of Music,
Drama and Art during curriculum lessons. They are facilitated towards this
creation and are encouraged to think critically about their creative process
via reflection points from the start to the end of the presentation. This
enhances their learning and allows them to practice their critical thinking
skills.</p>
<p>For instance, the Lower Secondary Music Programme allows students to work
as an ensemble and as soloists towards creating and improvising musical
performances with original beats or rhythms using physical instruments
as well as music created with the help of apps like Bandlabs. Art lessons
steer students towards considering perspectives of 2D and 3D works. The
end result ranges from creative and eye-catching paintings, agamographs
and tunnel books that can be found showcased around Xinmin. Their art-work
even goes online through the use of applications like FlipaClip that help
build creative animations. RefleXions@ Xinmin allows students to ‘play’
via Drama as they explore stories and provide their perspective and responses
through Dramatic performances.</p>
<p><strong>Connect</strong> 
<br>Arts Education in Xinmin allows students to connect with one another,
with the world and draw connections across various subjects relevant to
their daily life.</p>
<p>Students work collaboratively across all the Arts Education opportunities
in Xinmin. It is through collaborative work that students learn to manage
themselves and their relationships, whilst gaining a deeper understanding
of the world around them. With Art, Music and RefleXions@Xinmin (Drama),
all encouraging group-based collaborations whether physically or through
online platforms like Padlet, Jamboard and Google Classroom, students are
continually reflecting upon their ability to consider perspectives of their
group mates and leading one another through presentations.</p>
<p>Students also have opportunities to sample the cultural offerings from
around the world! World Music exposure allows students to do things like
appreciate Malay rhythmic music. Art lessons allow students to understand
ceramics from Singaporean Ceramic makers whilst Drama O-level lessons provide
students an understanding of the influences of European practitioners like
Konstantin Stanislavski and Bertolt Brecht.</p>
<p>The sensemaking does not stop there with skills and knowledge utilised
across subjects. Students develop their awareness of the world around them
and learn more about what makes Singapore unique through an exploration
that encompasses Music, Art and Drama. Soundscapes from Music lessons are
utilised to create performances in RefleXions that are heavily influenced
by the perspectives explored in Art lessons! Through RefleXions, students
use Drama as a means to evaluate decision making in their daily lives and
how they can best negotiate building relationships with friends, family
and the wider community.</p>

<p>Sharing their Art presentations with their peers and the wider community
is also highly encouraged and gives students a massive sense of pride in
whatever they do. Students are given the opportunity to showcase their
artistic talents to students of Xinmin through hallway exhibitions as well
as through platforms like school major events such as Speech Day, Xinmin
Arts Week and Homecoming. Recently, students got their pieces featured
in the Alumni Exhibition that was open to the public. This gave the students
a sense of pride in their work!</p>

<p><strong>Cultivate</strong> 
<br>Arts Education in Xinmin believes strongly in cultivating a love for the
arts whilst building up student character. Deeply rooted with an objective
of providing students with 21st Century Competencies, the programme is
grounded on producing students who actively work on being resilient, responsible
and respectful individuals.</p>
<p>All Arts Education programmes focus on students exercising self-directedness
in their creative process which tests their resilience and responsibility
towards the task. Being allowed to take ownership of their work comes with
them showing strong character to follow through to their presentations.
Teachers facilitate lessons with the development of student character in
mind as they reflect not just about the lessons, process and learning but
also about both their and their peer’s contribution.</p>
<p>Above all, the programme is inclusive for all students and aims towards
students enjoying the different arts opportunities afforded to them. Students
may not leave Xinmin as practitioners or artistes but we aim towards students
who see the joy, beauty and developmental opportunities in the Arts.</p>
<p><strong>Inquiry-based Learning</strong> 
<br><strong>Developing Curious Learners</strong> 
<br>Reflective thinking is encouraged across all art-forms with teachers actively
facilitating students’ responses to the various stimuli they are provided.
Students are curious learners and critical thinkers as they make connections
between the art-forms and the world around them.
<br>
<br>Students develop as reflective critical thinkers through:</p>

<p><strong>Use of E-Pedagogy for Active Learning</strong>
<br>Across all art-forms, the exchanges of videos, sound clips and the use
of shared spaces facilitate live learning and discussions. Students get
to collaborate and share ideas with their peers. They also get to showcase
their work to receive feedback and responses from teachers and peers.</p>
<p>Students are also exposed to technology in their learning through digital
art platforms on their Personal Learning Device (PLD). During Art lessons,
students are guided through the intricacies of drawing via digital devices
as well as the added features they can take advantage of. Collaborative
portfolios parked online for peers to observe and critique work allows
for Assessment for Learning. Students are also excited to create their
own Artistic animations through E-platforms like the Flipaclip application.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Arts_Education/Department_programmes/aesthetics_5a.jpg">
</div>
<p>For Music, critical thinking and reflections are done via E- platforms
like Padlet as students utilise them to critique performance pieces. This
allows for students to enhance their performance standards as the feedback
derived assesses their learning and promotes a culture of active sharing
and collaboration. At a higher level, students are even allowed to compose
and mix their own pieces of music/soundscapes as they are guided through
the utilisation of the online Bandlab application.</p>
<p>In Drama lessons, students are able to record their rehearsals and review
their recordings with the rubrics given. In addition, students from other
groups will be able to give feedback and critique their peer’s performances
on their PLDs. This would allow them to exchange thoughts and perspectives
which allows them to understand different points of view.</p>
