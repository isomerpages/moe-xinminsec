### ELEMENTS OF BUSINESS

The Technology & Business Department oversees Elements of Business Skills (EBS), which is offered as an elective subject during Secondary 3 for the Normal (Technical) course. 
The curriculum is designed to introduce students to key business concepts, with a particular emphasis on basic marketing and customer relations, all while considering the Singaporean context. Besides offering students an opportunity to acquire fundamental business knowledge and develop versatile employability skills, the program exposes them to three distinct service sectors: Travel and Tourism, Hospitality, and Retail industries. Additionally, the acquisition of 21st-century skills through this program will not only benefit their current academic pursuits and employment but also prepare them for success in future educational endeavors and professional careers.
