<h2>Belief</h2>
<p>Studying Computing/Computer Applications (CPA) goes beyond syntax or block
programming in XMS. As an extension to MAKERS@Xinmin, we offer our students
Computing as a GCE-O Level Subject/G3 level and Computer Applications as
a GCE-N Level subject/G1 level.</p>
<p>Computing/CPA will foster in our students the necessary digital literacies,
whilst enhancing their problem-solving abilities through computational
thinking. Based on the Computer Education Framework (MOE), students are
instilled with many concepts that will inculcate them the necessary 21CC
through the different lesson designs.</p>
<p>Through various online platforms, students will become adaptable and proficient
in many digital tools that can later be applied in different fields. This
not only opens up diverse career opportunities but also instills ethical
awareness. With extensive hands-on experience, our students will enjoy
applying their newfound skills through many challenges and competitions.</p>

how they can apply what they've learned in their future endeavors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talent Development</strong>
<br><u>GCE-O Level Computing</u>
<br>Mini Projects (Pygame) are open-ended tasks carried out as part of Secondary
3 curriculum over 8 weeks. The project will be based on authentic tasks
founded on real-world problems. There are 2 proposed implementations for
the Mini Project, either hardware-based or software-based. Students can
choose to use either Halocode/Microbit microcontroller to create contraptions
as a solution prototype to an identified problem in the community. Past
projects include Recycling Shower for Toilet Flushes and Medicine boxes
to remind Elderly. Students may also choose to use Unity or Pygame to create
a gaming project that has NE themes.</p>
<p><u>Other Competitions</u>

<h3>ELEMENTS OF BUSINESS</h3>
<p>The Technology &amp; Business Department oversees Elements of Business
Skills (EBS), which is offered as an elective subject during Secondary
3 for the Normal (Technical) course. The curriculum is designed to introduce
students to key business concepts, with a particular emphasis on basic
marketing and customer relations, all while considering the Singaporean
context. Besides offering students an opportunity to acquire fundamental
business knowledge and develop versatile employability skills, the program
exposes them to three distinct service sectors: Travel and Tourism, Hospitality,
and Retail industries. Additionally, the acquisition of 21st-century skills
through this program will not only benefit their current academic pursuits
and employment but also prepare them for success in future educational
endeavors and professional careers.</p>

<p><strong>Our Pedagogical Approach</strong>
<br>In XMS , students engage in a diverse range of learning activities, including
Learning Journeys, workshops, and competitions. These activities are meticulously
designed to enrich their educational journey and expand the practical application
of their knowledge. The primary goal is to empower students to develop
21st-century skills, particularly in the domains of information literacy
and global awareness.</p>
<p>The classes within this program seamlessly blend both online and offline
components. Students are proficient in utilizing online platforms such
as Classpoint, SLS, and Google Classroom to express their ideas and collaborate.
Furthermore, they gain practical experience through hands-on activities
like creating marketing pamphlets and participating in mini-games. These
activities serve as integral aspects of their assessments, allowing them
to apply their conceptual and evaluative skills effectively.</p>
<p>An essential element of the program occurs in Secondary 4, where students
are tasked with demonstrating their decision-making and information literacy
prowess by curating sourced information. In Secondary 3, students have
the opportunity to conduct research, assess information, and provide well-founded
recommendations for improving various business aspects, focusing on a business
they identify themselves. Additionally, a one-day learning journey involves
simple interviews and visits to nearby malls for data collection and ground
survey reports. Through these experiences, students gain exposure to current
trends and innovations in the Singaporean business landscape, enhancing
their understanding of the challenges local businesses encounter.</p>
