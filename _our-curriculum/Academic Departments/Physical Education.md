<h2>Belief:</h2><p>To develop in our students a love for play, to equip them with the knowledge and skills to pursue an active lifestyle and to use PE and sports as a vehicle to instill the values of respect, resilience and responsibility.</p><h2>Sports and Games in Xinmin</h2><p><strong>1) PE lessons and Inter – Class Games:</strong><br>The PE curriculum in Xinmin comprises of 4 main domains: Sports and Games, Physical Health and Fitness, Outdoor Education and First Aid/CPR/AED. The PE teachers use a wide range of approaches to engage our students. The games concept approach lends itself well to bring about tactical awareness in games. Experiential learning guides our outdoor education modules and E – pedagogy, in particular video analysis, facilitates our students to improve their skills and techniques in games and in the fitness modules. The annual Inter – Class Games for every level provides an opportunity for our students to apply the knowledge and skills they have gained in an authentic, competitive setting.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="margin: auto;

Where possible, the PE teacher-student ratio is intentionally kept low to provide them with greater attention during workout sessions. Games are a key feature with the emphasis on enjoying physical activity and never weight loss. Non-overweight students are invited to participate in PRIDE games to promote social bonding and interaction with their friends while encouraging them to enjoy games. Overweight students are assessed quarterly on three physical activity stations and their results are communicated to them to serve as feedback for further improvement. More importantly, their results are not benchmarked against any standards, such as NAPFA, to motivate students in enjoying physical activity instead of focusing on weight loss. The emphasis is always on improvement rather than success or failure.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_1.jpg" src="/images/Physical_Education/Department_programmes/physical_education_2b.jpg"></div><p>Games sessions with non – P.R.I.D.E students to promote social bonding</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_2.jpg" src="/images/Physical_Education/Department_programmes/physical_education_2c.jpg"></div><p>P.R.I.D.E workout sessions</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>3) Cross – Country/Inter – CCA Carnival</strong></p><p>The Cross-Country meet and Inter – CCA Carnival are biennial mass events that alternate every year. Our Cross - Country is conducted at Sengkang Riverside Park and students can choose to run competitively or simply take a leisure walk. The Inter – CCA Carnival is conducted in school and is a platform for CCAs to compete against one another. Both events are organized by students, for the students and this provides an opportunity for them to pick up organizational and leadership skills.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_1.jpg" src="/images/Physical_Education/Department_programmes/physical_education_3a.jpg"></div><p>Xinmin Cross – Country aka Xinathon</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_2.jpg" src="/images/Physical_Education/Department_programmes/physical_education_6e.jpg"></div><p>Students being flagged off for our Cross – Country 2022.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_1.jpg" src="/images/Physical_Education/Department_programmes/physical_education_3b.jpg"></div><p>Students participating in games planned by student – led organising committee for the Inter – CCA Carnival.</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width=" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_2.jpg" src="/images/Physical_Education/Department_programmes/physical_education_6d_1.jpg"></div><p>Novelty games for the Inter – CCA Carnival.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_1.jpg" src="/images/Physical_Education/Department_programmes/physical_education_6c.jpg"></div><p>Non-Rockclimbing CCA students participating in a Bouldering competition at the Inter – CCA Carnival</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Math_2.jpg" src="/images/empty_generic.png"></div><p><br></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>4) School Sports Partnership with ActiveSG:</strong></p><p>The School Sports Partnership (SSP) provides an opportunity for passionate students in Secondary 2 and 3 to further develop their knowledge and skills in football, basketball and badminton.
