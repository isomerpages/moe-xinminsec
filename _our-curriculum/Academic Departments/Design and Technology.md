Belief
------------------
In D&T, the students learn through design-and-make projects guided by a design process. The students will learn to identify the user’s needs by analysing problems identified. They will also learn sketching skills and ideation techniques to generate design solutions.![](/images/Design_And_Technology/Department_programmes/dnt_model.png)

**Our Pedagogical Approach**
D&T offers opportunities for the students to develop predominantly critical and inventive thinking skills such as sound reasoning, decision making and managing complexities and ambiguities. It also offers opportunities for students to become more curious and to develop creativity as they go about designing and creating prototypes to solve real-world problems. When the students seek understanding of user needs in their design-and make projects, it offers opportunities for them to develop global and social-cultural sensitivity and awareness. Through research for gathering relevant data and data interpretation, students also get to learn communication, collaboration and information skills.
Through consideration of functionality, environmental and user concerns –
•	Students will develop the design solution into a workable solution. 
•	Use digital mock-ups as quick prototyping to test and evaluate the design solution to further refine it. 
•	Handle and gain competence in the use of different workshop tools and equipment to produce the prototype of the design solution.
Students will familarise themselves with Google Classroom resources and rubrics for their submissions and they will 
•	Peer evaluation and constructive critique
•	Understanding digital rubric demands and inquiring for further refinement 
•	Digital Prototyping through Sketchbook (Lower Sec) Application.
•	Doing 3d sketching and transferring designs to Google Sketchup (Upper Sec)
•	Google Classroom and SLS for Lesson Objects
•	Compare and contrast of similar function items.
