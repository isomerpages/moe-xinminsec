<h2>Belief</h2>
<p>In D&amp;T, the students learn through design-and-make projects guided
by a design process. The students will learn to identify the user’s needs
by analysing problems identified. They will also learn sketching skills
and ideation techniques to generate design solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Our Pedagogical Approach</strong>
<br>D&amp;T offers opportunities for the students to develop predominantly
critical and inventive thinking skills such as sound reasoning, decision
making and managing complexities and ambiguities. It also offers opportunities
for students to become more curious and to develop creativity as they go
about designing and creating prototypes to solve real-world problems. When
the students seek understanding of user needs in their design-and-make
projects, it offers opportunities for them to develop global and social-cultural
sensitivity and awareness. Through research for gathering relevant data
and data interpretation, students also get to learn communication, collaboration
and information skills.</p>
<p>Through consideration of functionality, environmental and user concerns
–</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students will develop the design solution into a workable solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use digital mock-ups as quick prototyping to test and evaluate the design
solution to further refine it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle and gain competence in the use of different workshop tools and
equipment to produce the prototype of the design solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students will familarise themselves with Google Classroom resources and
rubrics for their submissions and they will</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Conduct peer evaluation and constructive critique</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding digital rubric demands and inquire for further refinement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carry out Digital Prototyping through Sketchbook (Lower Sec) Application-.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doing 3-D sketching and transfer designs to Google Sketchup (Upper Sec)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Google Classroom and SLS for Lesson Objects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare and contrast similar function items-.</p>
