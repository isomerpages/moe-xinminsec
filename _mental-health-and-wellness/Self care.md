## Self-care

What is self-care?<br>
Self-care is important to maintaining a healthy relationship with yourself. It means doing things to take care of our minds and bodies by engaging in activities that promote well-being and reduce stress. Doing so enhances our ability to live fully, vibrantly, and effectively. The practice of self-care also reminds both you and others that your needs are valid and a priority.

Self-care isn't just about finding ways to relax. It's about taking care of yourself mentally, physically, emotionally, socially, and spiritually. To care for your health and well-being, it is important to find a balance that allows you to address each of these areas. Sometimes you might need more self-care in one specific area to restore balance or find relief from a stressor in your life.
