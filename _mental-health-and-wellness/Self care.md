<h2>Self-care</h2><p>What is self-care?<br>Self-care is important to maintaining a healthy relationship with yourself. It means doing things to take care of our minds and bodies by engaging in activities that promote well-being and reduce stress. Doing so enhances our ability to live fully, vibrantly, and effectively. The practice of self-care also reminds both you and others that your needs are valid and a priority.</p><p>Self-care isn't just about finding ways to relax. It's about taking care of yourself mentally, physically, emotionally, socially, and spiritually. To care for your health and well-being, it is important to find a balance that allows you to address each of these areas. Sometimes you might need more self-care in one specific area to restore balance or find relief from a stressor in your life.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Well%20Being%20Guide/Mental%20Health%20and%20Wellness/mental_health_4.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Well%20Being%20Guide/Mental%20Health%20and%20Wellness/mental_health_5.png"></div><p>Check out how to start a self-care plan <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/self-care-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
