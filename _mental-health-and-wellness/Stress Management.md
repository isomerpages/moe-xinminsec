## Stress Management
The most dangerous aspect of stress is how easily it can creep up on you. You think that you got used to it. It may start to feel familiar, or even normal. You may not notice how much it is affecting you, even as it exacts a heavy toll.

If you often feel frazzled and overwhelmed, it is time to take action to bring your emotional and physical health back on track.

Since it is not entirely possible to cut out all forms of stress from our lives, it is even more important - and realistic - that we learn how to cope with it. We have the power to keep our stress under control. Discover some of these stress-busting powers!
