Approaches
----------

**_Learning Experiences_**

We believe that by helping students connect their conceptual understanding to authentic real-world problems, it will spark off their curiosity in the subject and elicit the joy of learning. Real world authentic tasks are infused in our day-to-day classrooms to develop critical and inventive thinking skills. Some of these tasks include bringing students out of the classrooms to investigate and record findings within the school compound and for them to draw relevance of mathematical problems to familiar environment and context. Students are also encouraged to work in a collaborative setting or to share their findings of these learning experiences with their peers which help enhance their reasoning and communication skills.

| Students using a clinometer to measure the angle of elevation of an emergency exit of a school block. This measurement can then be used to calculate the height of the emergency exit.      | Students applying concepts of map scales to calculate the actual distance between school and the nearby neighbourhood hawker center.     | Students engaging in a collaborative task and consolidating their learning on SLS platform.     |



  

**_Active Learning through ICT-Infused Lessons_**

The use of technology is used to maximise students’ learning by emphasizing positive students’ interactions and student’s agency. E-learning platforms such as SLS and Google Classroom encourage both self-directed and collaborative learning. Students are able to acquire mathematical knowledge at their own pace and teachers are able to provide timely and more customised feedback. In addition, the use of ICT tools such as Desmos and GeoGebra promotes better visualization and deeper learning in abstract topics such as Geometry, Trigonometry and Graphs.

  

**_Beyond Classroom_**

To extend learning beyond textbook and classroom, we have a range of talent development programmes tailored for our students who express keen interest and passion for the subject. Refer to the talent development programme webpage to find out more about our four-levels mathematics academy.
