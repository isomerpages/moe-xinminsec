Belief
------

To nurture in our students a fierce curiosity in the Humanities, and a deep sense of care and empathy for the world – physical and human, past, present and future.

Approaches
----------

_**Inquiry-based Learning**_ <br>
This approach places the students at the heart of teaching and learning to develop them into confident, self-directed, critical and reflective thinkers. We activate learning through the asking and co-creation of inquisitive questions about the syllabus content. This often serves as a “hook” for students to feel curious in the process of learning. We then tap into their prior knowledge and build on that through the study and analysis of authentic sources of information. Students then synthesise the knowledge and sense-make with the facilitation of teachers. A conclusion is often formed and this can restart the inquiry cycle once again as they reflect on what they have learnt.

**_Use of E-Pedagogy for Active Learning_** <br>
Technology can be powerful in the Humanities classroom as it allows students to tap on multi-modal presentations of information, including current articles, statistical data and videos. It also creates opportunities for students to enjoy an out-of-classroom experience through virtual learning. In facilitating the inquiry approach, students also harness the affordances of technology to collaborate with peers, present findings and interact with teachers for more tailored feedback.


**Talent Development in the Humanities** <br>
We recognise and value the talent students may have in the Humanities and we seek to nurture this talent with the hope that these students are inspired to pursue an education or career path in the Humanities. These are some opportunities we curate for our students to hone their talent.
