Dear Xinmin students and Parents/ Guardians,

The Sec 3 Subject Combination 2024 provides students with the opportunity to pursue subjects they are passionate about at the upper secondary level. To help with the subject combination information, a microsite has been set up for parents/guardians and students to understand more about the demands of certain elective subjects at the Upper Secondary level, gather advice on making subject combination decisions and learning more about post-secondary pathways. You will also find the list of subject combinations offered and a timeline for the Subject Combination Allocation Exercise. <br>

Thank you.
