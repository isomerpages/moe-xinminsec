**Procedures** <br>
Students who have taken the PSLE are posted into schools via the Secondary One (S1) Posting Exercise. School admissions are based on merit and choice of secondary school made by the individual student.

  

**Appeals** <br>
Appeals that take place after the S1 Posting Exercise must be aligned to these principles, in order to be fair to the other admitted students. While students may appeal directly to the Xinmin Secondary School for admission, they must meet the cut-off point of the school before their appeal will be considered.

  

Please access the below link provided and submit your childâ€™s appeal together with other relevant documents after the Sec 1 posting results. All appeals must be submitted by&nbsp;**<u>Wednesday, 29 December 2021, 3pm</u>**. As vacancies are limited, only successful candidates will be notified by the school.

Students who would like to gain admission to the school on the basis of other talents and achievements, e.g. those in sports or arts, already have the option of an alternative admissions pathway in the form of the Direct School Admissions (DSA) Exercise which was conducted before the PSLE.

  

**Requirements to offer Higher Mother Tongue Languages (HMTL) at Sec 1** <br>
Students who meets the following criteria will be offered by MOE to study HMT at Sec 1:

1\. Students in the top 10% of the PSLE;

2\. Students in the top 30% who score an A\* in Mother Tongue Language, or a Merit in HMTL in PSLE.

  

For students who do not meet the above criteria will still be offered to study Higher Chinese Language (HCL) / Higher Malay Language (HML) if they are found suitable based on the criteria set by the school.

For students studying Tamil Language, Non-Tamil Indian Languages (Bengali / Gujarati / Hindi / Punjabi / Urdu) and other Foreign and Asian Languages, they will have to attend these lessons outside the school at the respective language centres.
