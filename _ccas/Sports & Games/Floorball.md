Floorball for boys is a new CCA introduced in Xinmin from 2022. It is a fast-paced indoor sport played using a ball and a stick. Floorball’s popularity has grown all over the world, including in Singapore where many post – secondary tertiary institutions have it as their CCA as well. The game is played with five outfield players and a goalkeeper from each team. It is physically demanding, requires teamwork and tests players’ ability to think and react fast. 

  

Even though the objective of sports is to win, the Xinmin Floorball teachers and coaches believe that it is more important to focus on the students’ character first before focusing on developing the necessary knowledge and skills needed for the game. Under the guidance of Mrs. Shanti Teo, teacher-in-charge and the coach, Coach Ysaac, we aspire to develop the Xinmin Floorball players to be sportsman grounded in good values and with a mindset for excellence.
