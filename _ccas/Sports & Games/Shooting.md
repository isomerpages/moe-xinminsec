The Xinmin Shooting Team was set up in 2004 to kindle students’ interest in 10m air rifle and air pistol shooting.

  

In shooting, mental fortitude and physical strength are equally important, as the sport demands consistency and precision. Through regular training, our shooters develop concentration and tenacity to overcome their greatest opponent: themselves.

  

To test their abilities, our shooters get to compete in invitational shooting competitions, as well as the coveted annual National School Games Shooting Championship.

  

Under the expert coaching of our professional coaches, to date, we have groomed at least 16 Xinmin students who were offered the opportunity to train in the National Youth Team.

  

Our shooters have worked hard to achieve good results at the 2021 NSG Shooting Championship. They have done well individually and as a team:
