Xinmin Rock Climbing was started in 2008 and is now in its 15th year running. Our belief has always been to develop core values like perseverance and discipline in our team members. These core values are continually emphasised in both training and competition. We also strive to develop teamwork, camaraderie and leadership in our members by providing various opportunities for our students to excel.

Over the course of their journey with Xinmin Rock Climbing, our climbers will learn basic climbing skills across three disciplines – bouldering, top rope, and lead climbing. They will take part in competitions and even organise their own – Xinmin Secondary School has been the proud organiser of the Inter Schools Bouldering Championships (ISBC) and primary school carnival X-calade. We welcomed about 200 competitors across the 'A,' 'B' and 'C' Divisions and were heartened by the success of the event. In 2023, we resumed X-calade and collaborated with Hougang Primary School to incorporate it into their National Primary Schools Sport Climbing Championships roster. 

As part of our efforts to expose our students to more aspects of climbing, we send them for various competitions across the three disciplines. Additionally, every two years, our students will get the chance to travel overseas on rock climbing trips where they will get to climb on natural rock.

In 2024, we look forward to the resumption of overseas trips and more competitions as well. We also anticipate welcoming the next generation of passionate and driven climbers.
