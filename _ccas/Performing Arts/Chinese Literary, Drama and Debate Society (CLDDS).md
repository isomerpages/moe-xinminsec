Since its establishment in 2004, the Chinese Literary, Drama and Debate Society (CLDDS) has been upholding its aims of disseminating culture and increasing students’ level of interest in Chinese. Xinmin Chinese Opera Troupe has been invited to perform in numerous countries, thus allowing students to showcase their talents. The Chinese Opera Troupe was unable to conduct activities as usual as COVID-19 loomed. Community engagements such as visits to Sengkang Community Hospital and the Chingay Procession were cancelled along with our usual face-to-face trainings. However, these obstacles did not put us down and we decided to conduct online trainings focusing on Chinese Opera history and enrichment instead. In the online sessions, students got to learn the different classic roles in Chinese Opera and were even able to practice a few moves under the supervision of the coaches! CLDDS will continue to work towards its aims and provide more opportunities for students to develop their talents.

  

新民中学中文戏曲团成立于2004年，致力于弘扬华族传统文化，提高学生对华文及其文化的兴趣。多年来，我们排演了许多精彩纷呈的剧目，如《哪吒闹东海》、《宝莲灯》、《穆桂英大破天门阵》、《双枪陆文龙》等，参加了许多国内外的演出，得到了各界人士的广泛好评。同时，我团也积极响应“让艺术走入社区”的号召，赴盛港综合医院为病患表演。但自从2020年受到疫情的影响，戏曲团不能如往常一样参加演出，甚至连日常的训练也受到影响。但我们仍坚持弘扬戏曲文化，通过线上课程，让学生了解更广泛的戏曲文化知识，并引导学生将戏曲知识延申至生活中，学会欣赏与戏曲有关的影视作品，学生们因此对戏曲产生了更浓厚的兴趣。2022年，疫情的阴霾即将过去，训练生活恢复正常，我团将于年底上演新剧《火凤凰》。
