Xinmin’s Guzheng Ensemble was established in 1993. Under the guidance of our dedicated instructor and teachers, the students honed their technical skills and developed an appreciation for Guzheng.

The Guzheng Ensemble is one of the highlights at annual school events such as Chinese New Year celebrations and Speech Days. Beyond school events, the Ensemble also have opportunities to perform at public events such as the 2013 Huayi Festival at the Esplanade Outdoor Theatre, and the 2017 River Hongbao at the Marina Bay Floating Platform. In 2015, to celebrate the launch of the school’s Creative Arts Complex (CAC), students also collaborated with other performing arts CCAs of the school to put up an environmental theatre. In 2016 and 2018, the Ensemble held her inaugural concerts as part of the Xinthesis V and Xinthesis VI series. These events not only allow our students to showcase their talents but also to share the beauty of Guzheng with others.

To deliver a harmonious piece of music that could captivate our audience, we place a strong emphasis on collaboration and teamwork, which requires students to develop important life skills such as communication, leadership and mutual respect. Additionally, we also offer opportunities for students to attend concerts of different genres to broaden our students’ appreciation for music.

Through these diverse experiences, the students were able to consistently receive the high accolades at the Singapore Youth Festival since 2001.
