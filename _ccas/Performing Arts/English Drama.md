The year began promisingly as preparations for the biannual Singapore Youth Festival started. After months of tiring yet passion-filled preparations, both teams put on their best for their performance. Despite the news of only attaining Accomplishment this year for both plays, it did not hinder us from putting forth our best for Sights of Xinmin, where we performed our SYF pieces for the school. Come the day of our performance, both acts were met with warm and emotional cheers from the audience, providing the Drama Club with a boost of morale. 

This thus marked the end of our beloved Secondary 4 Drama Club members’ journeys with us. A humble farewell of food, heartfelt letters and video compilations were brought out to wish them the best for their future endeavours. For the rest of the year, we continued to play bonding games, as well as activities which upped our repertoire of theatrical techniques, such as improvisation exercises, as well as learning more about naturalism and other varying types and methods of theatre. We aim to build a strong ensemble of performers, both in terms of skills as well as teamwork, and this goal will remain for as long as the Xinmin English Drama Club remains. And with that, “Drama, that’s a wrap!”
