The Xinmin English Drama Club aims to groom a troupe of talented and confident young performers through a series of tailored programmes and the guidance of experienced instructors. Students are provided with a platform to showcase their artistic potential and are awarded with opportunities to excel in various aspects of drama. They can demonstrate their creativity by contributing on-stage and off-stage in areas including acting, stage management, directing, writing, planning events and creating stage props and costumes. Through weekly training sessions and various internal and external performances, students can uncover their own hidden talents in acting, develop their voices and gain confidence in expressing themselves. And most of all, forged close bonds as a result of many hours of training and collaboration as a team.

  

Our students devised, and staged three productions entitled, ‘Lao Jiu’, ‘No Parking on Odd Days’ and ‘Error 404’ at our annual Drama Night. The original production, ‘Error 404’ was written and directed by our very own Sec 4 Drama members, Aqiel, Ryan and Nargis. 

Most importantly, English Drama is a place where ideas are shared and friendships are forged.
