Xinmin Art Club (XAC) is all about learning through fun activities. We aim to provide opportunities for members to develop leadership, character and team spirit and hone their artistic flair through various activities such as camps, art workshops, museum visits, Co-currricular Activity Orientations, partnership with community partners and Open House. Most importantly, XAC is a place where ideas are shared and friendships are forged.

  

Besides these formal learning and sharing sessions, we also seek opportunities to engage the community through events such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) art labs and balloon sculpting workshops. We often participate in various art competitions to see fellow artists from other schools in action. This is because we strongly believe that it is important to gain exposure and increase our knowledge by learning from others.
