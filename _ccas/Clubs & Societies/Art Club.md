Welcome to Xinmin Art Club (XAC)

At Xinmin Art Club (XAC), we're all about the joy of learning through creativity and fun-filled activities. Our mission is to nurture and develop Curious learners, Compassionate contributors, and Confident leaders. Hence, we grow the artistic and leadership potential of our members while fostering a sense of compassion and confidence. Here's a glimpse into what we're all about:

**Leadership Development:**<br>
Our Executive-committee leaders play a pivotal role in shaping the club's journey. They hone their leadership skills by spearheading our key programs, including Xin-play, dynamic partnerships with primary schools, and a cherished arts collaboration with Sparkletots. They also lead initiatives like Open House and Secondary 1 CCA orientation programs, ensuring a warm welcome for new students through bonding activities and engaging arts programs.
Creative Collaboration: 

Our leaders and members join forces to organize the Upcycling Competition for Secondary 1 students in the second term. This competition not only teaches the art of upcycling but also encourages participants to design innovative and useful upcycled products.

**Artistic Excellence:**<br>
Members of XAC proudly represent our school in various arts competitions, refining their artistic talents and flair. We actively participate in art initiatives, embracing opportunities to showcase our creativity in projects like wall mural designs and captivating artworks. Most recently, we hosted our Art Club Art exhibition at Reflections Theatre during Homecoming Day, leaving an indelible mark on our school's artistic landscape.

**Community Engagement:**<br>
Beyond our school walls, XAC seeks to engage with the wider community. We regularly participate in events such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) art labs and various art workshops. These experiences enable our members to gain exposure, learn from fellow artists, and expand their artistic horizons.

Xinmin Art Club is not just a club; it's a vibrant community where ideas are shared, friendships are forged, and creativity knows no bounds. Whether through camps, art workshops, museum visits, Co-curricular Activity Orientations, or our partnerships with community organizations, our members actively contribute to the school while enjoying the boundless world of art.

Join us on our artistic journey at XAC, where creativity knows no limits, and learning is a lifelong adventure. Together, we explore, create, and inspire!
