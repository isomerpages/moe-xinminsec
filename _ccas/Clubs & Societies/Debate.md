The Xinmin Debate Club encourages its members to think critically and intelligently on a given issue, develop an informed opinion and to express that opinion in a clear and persuasive manner. Students are involved in friendly as well as national competitions.

  

These are the competitions which the debaters took part in this year, running the range from those for experienced debaters to ones for novices, giving them an opportunity to pit their skills against others.

**CCA Achievements**  <br>
XMS Debate Club has participated in multiple competitions including the National Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships and have even competed against international opponents at the WoLCe World Inter-School Debating Competition. 

  

The school made it to the semi-finals of the National Singapore Schools Debating Championships in 2022 with three students finishing amongst the top 20 speakers of the championship. The overall best speaker for the championship came from XMS Debate Club. The school is proud of the tenacious effort the members have put into each competition and their attitude towards learning.

  

Aside from simply taking part in competitions, the club seeks to foster an attitude of gratitude and camaraderie. Each member learns that he or she can only be as strong as the support given by all the other members and that every member is a valued contributor of the club.
