In St. John Brigade (SJB), cadets participate in a myriad of activities such as home nursing, hospital attachment, camping, outdoor activities and more, over the course of 4 years. Cadets undergo continual upgrading of their first aid skills and knowledge during weekly trainings. This enables them to assist in rendering first aid during school and public events. At the time of each cadet’s graduation from Xinmin Secondary, s/he would have attained, at least, Certification in Basic First Aid and/or Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) + Automated External Defibrillator (AED).

  

Beyond acquiring skills that our cadets can use during critical situations, SJB provides an important platform for them to relate to their peers through problem-solving and teambuilding. Cadets also take turns to lead their peers during weekly trainings so as to improve on their communication skills. The activities and challenges in SJB aim to contribute to the holistic growth of the cadets so that they may become outgoing and confident leaders who are physically and socially active; who learn to not only work well in teams, but also to extend their reach to positively impact society.

  

It is the high standards and continuous commitment of our student leaders, youth officers, and teachers that led SJB to bag its 19th Gold for the Corps Achievement Award since 2001.
