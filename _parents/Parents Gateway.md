The Parents Gateway (PG) Mobile App is an initiative by MOE to enable parents to interact with schools more conveniently on administrative and financial matters. Parents will also be able to use this app to receive our monthly school newsletters, stay updated about our programmes, and submit online consent forms for their childâ€™s activities.<br>The PG App will be implemented in all MOE schools in 2019. For parents with two or more children and they are in different schools, you will be able to receive notifications for all your children on the same PG App. <br>All parents are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to 
<strong>download and use the PG App</strong> as it will bring significant benefits for parents, teachers and the school.</p>
