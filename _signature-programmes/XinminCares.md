Cultivating Compassion, Creating Change
-------

**What is it?**<br>
The XinminCares Programme is our signature Values-In-Action (VIA) programme in the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum. This programme actively includes all Secondary 1 and 2 students. 

**Why we do it?**<br>
Through XinminCares, we hope to develop every Xinmin student into a compassionate contributor who respects diverse perspectives and needs of different individuals and recognises his/her ability to address issues in our community. 

**How we do it?**<br>
We prioritise teaching our students the value of sincerity in their time and efforts. We start by guiding them to think about the needs of the organisations and individuals they are interacting with. This understanding helps them connect on a deeper level, enabling them to act and contribute in a genuinely meaningful way. 

**Our Students’ XinminCares Projects**
XinminCares provides opportunities for students to play a part to make their greater community a more inclusive and caring place for everyone. At the Secondary One level, our students get the chance to interact and befriend elderly residents in Thye Hwa Kwan Nursing Home. At the Secondary Two level, students are given opportunities to plan their own advocacy projects according to the needs of our partners, Fei Yue Community Services, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), and Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC). 

**Captions:**<br>
**1+2** (feel free to choose)– Our Sec 1 students underwent an ageing simulation to make sense of some difficulties the elderly may have in their daily activities.

**3+4** – Our Sec 1 students making meaningful connections with residents at Thye Hua Kwan Nursing Home through self-planned activities and materials. 

**5-7** – Our Sec 2 students bonding with seniors at Fei Yue's Intergenerational Learning Programme after leading inspiring workshops!

**8** – Our students’ care packs were well received by the newly-arrived Chinese migrant brothers.

**9** – Our Sec 2 students sharing what they learnt about kidney diseases and health to their juniors.

**We want to make a difference!**<br>
Through XinminCares, our students are encouraged to be active and reflective contributors who take responsibility for their community. Through taking concrete action, students will appreciate the many complex societal issues and challenges that their community and nation face and commit to make a positive impact to address such issues within their sphere of influence.
 
 
**What our Students Say**<br>
In our XinminCares sessions, the class got to engage in activities that helped us understand elderly citizens better. My most memorable experience of that was when we visited the nursing home near our school and spent time with the elderly residents there. It was heartwarming, to listen to and interact with them. This experience taught me how to communicate and understand them better and throughout all the sessions, I realised the importance of respecting and valuing the elderly in our society.

Having the opportunity to collaborate with NKF was truly a memorable journey as it urged us to understand more about the life of an NKF patient and what they have to go through in their daily life. Xinmincares also helped us learn various ways to support patients and how to prevent kidney failure for ourselves. This year’s XinminCares has definitely taught us many different values that will stick with us for life!! (by Mathilda Goh, 205)
Talking to the seniors at Thye Hua Kwan taught me the importance of treasuring life, staying positive and how everyone deserves someone to talk to. (by Lim Zhining, 101)
