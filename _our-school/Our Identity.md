#### Our School Song's Translation

Xinmin Xinmin <br>
We want to be the master of our destiny <br>
We want to be the beacon of our time <br>
Not through rote learning; but through the training of a versatile mind <br>
With keen wit and a readiness to put knowledge into practice <br>
Xinmin Xinmin <br>
We want to develop an analytical mind <br>
We want to cultivate an innovative spirit <br>
For love, integrity, freedom and peace <br>
Xinmin Xinmin
