### **_Home-based Learning Day_**

Blended Learning aims to provide students with a seamless blend of different modes of learning. The main aspect of Blended Learning is the integration of Home-Based Learning (HBL) as a regular feature of the schooling experience.

  

To achieve the intended outcomes of Blended Learning, HBL days in Xinmin are held once every fortnight to inculcate the practice of self-directed learning. HBLs days are loosely structured to provide scope for students to exercise self-directedness and self-management as they learn the curriculum content. HBL days also provide dedicated time and space for students to explore their interests and learn outside the curriculum (termed as “student-initiated learning”). Lastly, HBL days leverage both technology and non-ICT modes to support the delivery and monitoring of students’ learning.

  

### **_Curriculum Considerations_**

The curriculum plan for the year (i.e., Scheme of Work) would incorporate curriculum coverage on HBL Days while still adhering to the scope of curriculum and the curriculum hours required. Learning activities for curriculum coverage will largely be asynchronous so that students can plan and manage their learning at a suitable pace for themselves. Learning activities on HBL Days can be ICT and non-ICT based.

  

### **_Student-Initiated Learning Considerations_**

Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) enables students to exercise agency, explore their interests and passions, and learn within and beyond the curriculum. SIL activities should be safe, wholesome, be grounded on shared national values and engender a spirit of lifelong learning. Students would have agency and choice over what they want to learn for SIL. SIL need not be onerous or demanding (e.g. an extended project). There are 3 main types of SIL activities – school-curated, school-facilitated, and fully student-initiated. Students would be given opportunities to reflect on and celebrate what they have learned during SIL.
