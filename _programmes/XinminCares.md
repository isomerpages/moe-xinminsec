The XinminCares Programme is our signature Values-In-Action (VIA) programme in the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum. Through XinminCares, we hope to develop every Xinmin student into a compassionate contributor who respects diverse perspectives and needs of different individuals and recognises his/her ability in addressing issues in our community.

  

XinminCares hence provides opportunities for students to play a part to make their greater community a more inclusive and caring place for everyone. At the lower secondary level, students get the chance to interact and befriend other people in the community, such as elderly residents, so as to develop a sense of empathy where he/she is able to recognise the strengths and perspectives of people who may be different from them. At the upper secondary level, students will be given opportunities to initiate their own projects to engage a particular group in the community that they have identified.  

  

In doing so, students are encouraged to be an active and reflective contributor who takes responsibility for their community. Through taking concrete action, students will appreciate the many complex societal issues and challenges that their community and nation face and commit to make a positive impact to address such issues within their sphere of influence.&nbsp;
