Local Transfer Admission

Local students from other schools can request for a transfer after the End-of-Year Examinations in October, subject to availability of places. If we have no vacancies, interested students will be placed on the waiting list and will be notified when a vacancy arises. Please submit the Appeal Form with the necessary documents to the General Office by the last day of school in Term 4.

Returning Singaporean Admission

To assist families intending to go for an overseas posting, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has put in place the Leave of Absence Scheme and the Boarding Award Scheme. MOE also assists returning Singaporeans in school admission to Singapore schools.
