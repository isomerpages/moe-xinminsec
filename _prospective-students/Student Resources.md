Local Transfer Admission
-----------
Local students from other schools can request for a transfer after the End-of-Year Examinations in October, subject to availability of places. If we have no vacancies, interested students will be placed on the waiting list and will be notified when a vacancy arises. Please submit the Appeal Form with the necessary documents to the General Office by the last day of school in Term 4.
