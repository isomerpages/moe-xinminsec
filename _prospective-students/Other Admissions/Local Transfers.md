<p>Local students from other schools can request for a transfer after the End-of-Year Examinations in October, subject to availability of places. If we have no vacancies, interested students will be placed on the waiting list and will be notified when a vacancy arises. Please submit the Appeal Form with the necessary documents to the General Office by the last day of school in Term 4.</p><p><a href="/files/Local%20Transfer%20Admission/Appeal%20form%20-%20other%20level%20as%20at%2001%20Dec%202021.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Appeal form - other level as at 01 Dec 2021.pdf</a></p>
