National Education is a key component of Singapore's education system and is integrated into the curriculum at all levels, from primary school to tertiary education. National Education seeks to foster a strong sense of belonging to Singapore among its citizens. This involves promoting a shared national identity, history, and culture.

Our students’ NE experience will include our NE Commemorative Days, NE in subjects (e.g. Character and Citizenship Education, History), Co-Curricular activities such as CCA/VIA and our daily routines such as flag raising ceremony. 
Our NE experience will anchor on the following 3 citizenship dispositions:

* **A sense of belonging**: To develop a deeper understanding of who we are, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation.
* **A sense of reality**: To be aware of the contemporary realities — including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.
* **A sense of hope**: Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.
In Xinmin, our NE commemorative events are led and planned by our students and strongly supported by different stakeholders of the school. For example, our school staff, alumni and parent volunteers also formed a contingent and participated in our 2023 National Day Parade! We hope that all students have a sense of shared mission to continue the legacy of our forefathers and strive for the peace and prosperity of our nation.
