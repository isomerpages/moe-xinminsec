Total Curriculum Plan and Level Themes
------


Our Total Curriculum Plan sets the direction for the implementation of the curriculum and co-curriculum to develop our students into **curious learners, confident leaders and compassionate contributors**. We adopt a thematic approach that is age-appropriate and developmentally progressive so that our students can navigate their years in Xinmin successfully

Each level theme is also aligned to our schoolâ€™s vision and is further defined by desired outcomes that we hope our students achieve so that they can embrace the future with confidence and optimism.
