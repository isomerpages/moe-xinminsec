Total Curriculum Plan and Level Themes
------


In Xinmin Secondary School, we believe in the holistic development of our students into curious learners, confident leaders and compassionate contributors. We adopt a thematic approach that is age-appropriate and developmentally progressive so that our students can navigate their years in Xinmin successfully.

Each level theme is also aligned to our schoolâ€™s vision and is further defined by desired outcomes that we hope our students achieve so that they can embrace the future with confidence and optimism.
